</div>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <span class='large'>UNDONE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There was a crush at Mrs. Evershed’s beautiful
house in Mark Place, and she now stood
at the head of the staircase receiving her guests.
Her face wore a smile, and conventional words
of welcome rose to her lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was a handsome woman of about forty,
and there were few people, even in Mayfair,
who entertained more brilliantly. To look at
her, her house, her servants, her guests, no one
would suppose that she had a care in the world,
and yet just behind that smiling face grim care
dwelt.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this very moment, while money was being
as lavishly expended as if it were mere water, she
herself was on the verge of bankruptcy. The
crisis was imminent; her creditors clamored.
It would be impossible to keep the wolf at bay
more than a few days longer. She knew of this,
but still she smiled and received her guests with
unction.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Meanwhile Barbara, Mrs. Evershed’s only
daughter, had hidden herself in the recess of a
curtained window. She was nineteen years of
age, and was considered one of the handsomest
girls who had made their <em>debut</em> that season.
Had she been worldly-minded, and only
thought of money, she might have made a
match which would have saved Mrs. Evershed
from all her money liabilities forever, but this
was not Barbara’s way.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was a rebellious girl; she had never
wanted for money, and could not realize the
fact that she might soon be penniless. With
sparkles in her eyes, lips slightly parted, and
cheeks with the glow of beautiful expectation
on them, she waited in her corner. Now and
then she peeped forward and glanced at her
mother. She knew perfectly well what her
mother’s thoughts were.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; she would like me to marry Lord
Selwyn,” thought the girl to herself. “No matter
even though he is seventy and ugly, and
they also say that he drinks; has he not eighty
thousand pounds a year, and would not the
money put all mother’s terrible money affairs
straight? But I won’t marry him; no, I won’t.
There is only one man whom I care for.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara was tall; her eyes were soft brown
with a starry light in them. She had quantities
of dark hair, too, which was coiled in a classical
fashion round her stately head. She was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>dressed in white silk, and held in her hand a
large feather fan.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have made up my mind,” she said again to
herself—“if Dick proposes to-night I shall accept
him. When mother really knows that I
am engaged to Dick she will think of some
other way of getting out of her difficulties. I
cannot and will not marry Lord Selwyn. As
to Luke Tarbot, they say he is rich too.” She
shuddered slightly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dick is the only man I will marry. If I
were Dick’s wife I could be a good woman.
It is true that he is only a briefless barrister at
present, but he has got brains. He suits me,
I suit him. I love him, and I will never, <em>never</em>
marry or love anybody else.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The crush in the beautiful rooms grew greater
and greater. Voices sounded close to Barbara.
She feared any moment that her hiding
place might be discovered; if so, good-by to
the treat she had promised herself when Dick
Pelham appeared. Presently one or two men
came and stood just outside the velvet curtain.
They talked and laughed, and once or twice
Mrs. Evershed’s name passed their lips. One
said to the other—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Those difficulties which Saunderson spoke
of last night at the club cannot be true. She
would not be so mad as to entertain in this
lavish style if they were.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, she does it for a blind,” was the reply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>of the other. “There is no way of keeping up
your credit like keeping up your debts. She
is a fool of course. By the way, they say that
handsome girl of hers might help her if she
would.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By marrying Selwyn?” said the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye. Why not? By marrying Selwyn and
saving the position.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The first man made an impatient movement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope the girl has too much self-respect,”
he said then.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara shivered behind her curtain. Very
little more would have made her scream. Her
silk dress made a slight noise as it rustled
against the balcony.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush, there may be some one near,” said
the first speaker. The men moved away, and
Barbara stepped on to the balcony. She leant
over the parapet and pressed her hands to her
hot cheeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is too bad,” thought the angry girl; “even
in mother’s own house they will not leave her
alone. I know who those men are, of course.
I recognized Mr. Ashford’s voice, and the other
is Mr. Seton. So our affairs are the common
talk of the clubs, and it is really expected that
I am to rescue mother by making a loveless
marriage. But I won’t—my life is my own; I
decline to sacrifice myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad to find you at last,” said a voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>in her ears. “I have been looking for you
everywhere. Why are you hiding yourself?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The rooms are so hot,” answered Barbara
shortly. “How do you do, Dr. Tarbot?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man held out his hand, which Barbara
just touched with her long, slim fingers. His
was a somewhat striking personality, and yet
he was not the least good-looking. He was
of medium height, thin in build: his brow was
broad and lofty, his eyebrows well marked, and
his deep gray eyes were full of light.</p>

<p class='c010'>That strange light was never absent from
the eyes, which in themselves were somewhat
pale in color, but with their black irises and
black surroundings made an important addition
to a decidedly remarkable face. The man’s
mouth was firm and cut in a straight line.</p>

<p class='c010'>He made the most of his height, holding
himself very erect, and now he looked full and
boldly into Barbara’s eyes. The balcony was
softly lit, and the girl could be seen quite distinctly.
The electric light, which was covered
with glass globes formed in the shape of lilies,
gave her an unreal appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad I have found you,” repeated Tarbot.
He spoke in a hurry, and as though he
were slightly out of breath. “I rushed off here
in great haste. I must see a patient again before
midnight. The man will probably die when
the new day dawns, and he has a longing to
have me with him when he breathes his last.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Barbara was silent, but her eyes, as if mesmerized,
fixed themselves on Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a relief to see you, Miss Evershed:
you look so bright—as if you had never known
sorrow or illness. The contrast between that
dying man’s agony and your grace and beauty
is enough to stagger one. Yes, I can stay but
for a quarter of an hour. I promised Mr. Harlington
to be with him when he died.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why did you leave him?” said Barbara
in her slow voice. She always spoke in a slow,
reflective sort of way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does not the contrast make you ill?” she
continued. “The frivolity of life one moment,
a death-bed the next. I do not know how you
doctors can live; you must get terribly hard
as the years go on. Well, I must go back to
our guests; mother will want me to help her.
There are a great many people here to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The rooms are packed and the heat is stifling.
Why should you join that overheated
throng? As to your mother wanting you, she
told me where I should find you, and said
nothing about asking you to go to her. Please
stay——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara paused with her hand upon the frame
of the open window.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes?” she asked in an interrogative way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should not have left a dying man if I had
not a special reason for doing so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes?” replied Barbara again.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“You are the reason.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am very sorry indeed to hear it, Dr. Tarbot.
I do not think your reason adequate.
Now I must go back to our guests.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must not,” said Dr. Tarbot firmly.
“I came here with the express purpose of seeing
you, and I will not be foiled. You will
stay with me for a moment or two. I want to
say, to say——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara returned once more to the balcony.
She saw that the man must have his opportunity,
and she knew that she was in for a bad
quarter of an hour. She closed her big fan
and held it in both hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know what I want to say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” replied Barbara. She made a short
pause before she uttered the single word.
Then she added, marked deliberation in her
tone, “Is it a gentlemanly action to detain a
girl against her will?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Barbara, you must know what I mean.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When did I give you leave, Dr. Tarbot, to
call me by my Christian name?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I used to call you Barbara when you were
a child. Do you never remember the old
days?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Those days are over,” answered Barbara.
“Now, please, say what you have to say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And then go, is that it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you speak?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will. My words can be soon said. I love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>you—I want you for my wife. I am determined
to win you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Determined!” said Barbara. “You are
very bold, Dr. Tarbot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was never a coward. I will plead with
you until I succeed. You are the only woman
in all the world whom I love. I will have
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will? Again I say you are bold.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For Heaven’s sake let us argue the matter
out quietly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is nothing whatever to argue. You
say you love me. I do not return your love,
therefore I cannot marry you. Are not those
words plain enough?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Plain as they are, they do not clinch this
business,” said the man, now trembling with
rage and suppressed passion. “I will plead
my cause and you must listen. What I feel for
you is more than ordinary love; it has been the
growth of years. Do you think just for a light
word I will give you up? I should make you
a good husband. As to your mother, I know
well what money difficulties she is in, but I
can put her straight. I am a young man—not
like Lord Selwyn.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not mention his name.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must, for report gives you to him. I
only say now what is the common talk of London.
I am a young man, and not in the least
like Selwyn. I hate a girl giving herself to an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>old man, but I am young and suitable as regards
age. I am clever, too, and doing splendidly
in my profession. Already I am considered
one of the greatest brain specialists of the
day. By and by I shall be a rich man. Already
I am anything but poor. I can put your
mother’s affairs quite straight, and I will if only
you will promise to be mine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not love you, and therefore I cannot
promise to be yours. Now, please, let me
go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not yet, not for a moment. Your love will
come. Promise to marry me, if not for my
sake, for your mother’s. Oh, Barbara, Miss
Evershed—it does not matter what I call you—you
will never repent it. If you were my
wife, I should be a good man. I do not pretend
that I am good now; I am just a desperate
fellow, but full of love for you. Have you
not been the star which I have set before me
since I was a lad? Say you will marry me;
say it—you will never regret it. If you do not
there will be mischief. Oh, Barbara, do not
give me up. Barbara, I shall go down, I shall
sink, I shall be ruined, if you refuse me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He paused at last, looking, with his eyes
burning with suppressed passion, into the girl’s
face. She did not shrink from his gaze, but
she changed her position. Some of the soft
golden light fell across her dress and on her
white arms, and gave a queer glow to the big
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>fan. Barbara unfurled it slowly, and held it
so as partly to hide her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sorry for you,” she said; “you must
try and get over this. But you have had my
answer; I cannot say anything different.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not refuse me now. Think, consider,
take time. I cannot, I cannot give you up to
another.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was such a genuine tone of agony in
the man’s voice that, in spite of herself, the
girl was slightly softened; her tone became
gentle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It pains me to give you pain,” she said,
“but you must consider my answer quite final.
It would be false kindness to give you the least
hope. I do not love you, I could never under
any circumstances love you; you do not in
any single particular suit me. As your wife I
should be miserable—I should be worse, I
should even be bad. I could never be the wife
of one I do not sincerely love. If you were
the last man left in the world I could not
marry you, Dr. Tarbot. Is not that decisive
enough?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is, and I am undone,” said Tarbot. His
face grew ghastly white; he staggered against
the window frame.</p>

<p class='c010'>Without a word Barbara turned and left him.
She entered the gaily lighted room. Tarbot,
leaning against the window frame, watched
her as she did so.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>A MAN’S REVENGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Barbara looked like a beautiful white lily.
Her long neck slightly drooped as she walked
down the room. Tarbot’s face as he watched
her became more and more ugly; the devil
was fairly aroused in him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I cannot have that woman for my wife
I shall go under,” he muttered. “But she
shall be mine—I swear it. Only a rival can
kill hope. If there is a rival, <em>if</em>”—he clenched
his hand—“he shall rue it,” he muttered; “the
man, whoever he is, shall rue it—he shall rue it
to his dying day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At that moment Tarbot’s worst fears were
confirmed. He could see well into the big
drawing-room, and just then he noticed a man
who, in irreproachable evening costume, with
a rose in his button-hole, came forward and
clasped one of Barbara’s white hands. The
man was tall, fair, and remarkably good-looking:
his face was clean-shaven, his mouth
sweet in expression, his eyes full of kindliness.
They were good eyes, gray in color and well
open.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Barbara looked up into his face, and there
was an expression in hers which Tarbot saw
and interpreted aright. That expression was
the last straw. It turned the disappointed
man’s blood into gall. He clenched both his
hands tightly. They were the hands of a surgeon—beautifully
formed, firm, and cool as
steel. He clenched them so hard now that
the nails penetrated the skin. His face felt
cold; a moment later it was bathed in perspiration.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fury ungovernable raged in his heart. He
trembled all over. For a moment he could
scarcely see clearly; then, rubbing one of his
hands across his eyes, he pulled himself together
with a great effort. Once more he bent
forward and glanced into the drawing-room.
The crowds were still there, the crush was at
its height, but the pair he sought had vanished.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So Dick Pelham is her choice,” muttered
Tarbot. “I know where I shall find them;
they are sure to be in one of the conservatories.
If I remember aright, this balcony runs right
round to the conservatories; I don’t mind
spying on them. Barbara is turning me into
a devil, and I shall act as one. Pelham looked
as if he meant to say something to-night; she
will reply. I must know all about it; I must
be in the thick of this matter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As Tarbot thought he began to creep along
the balcony. Presently he found himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>standing outside the great conservatory. The
windows were all wide open. Tarbot stationed
himself in deep shadow; he could hear almost
every word which was spoken within the glass
walls. At first there was a confusion of sound,
then two voices, distinct and clear, fell on the
man’s ears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must have your answer, Barbara,” said
Pelham. His voice was eager and tremulous.
“Say yes or no to me at once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a pause, then came Barbara’s
reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have loved you for long years, Dick; I
shall never love anybody else. I would willingly
become engaged to you but for mother.
But mother is miserable and anxious. She has
got into great money difficulties. She hopes
against hope that I will relieve the strain by
marrying a rich man, but, Dick, I cannot do
it. I would do much for mother, but I cannot
destroy my whole life even for her. You are
the only one I love; I cannot give you up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s right, Barbara; that’s plucky!”
said the young man. “Then you will become
engaged to me, darling?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can neither give you up nor become
engaged to you. You see for yourself, do you
not, how I am pulled both ways? It would
drive mother mad at the present crisis if I were
to tell her that all hope is over—that I am
engaged to you and will not look at any other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>man. Oh, Dick! my heart is torn. I am an
unhappy, miserable girl!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You ought to tell her the truth,” said Pelham.
“She has no right whatever to coerce
you. Tell her to-night; tell her you are engaged
to me. I do not expect her to consent
to our marriage just at present, but at least she
ought to know of the engagement.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But we are not engaged.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, but we ought to be—where is the difficulty?
Barbara, it will be such an incentive.
I shall work like a horse, and I know I shall
get on. I have brains and pluck. You won’t
have long to wait—I vow it. Already I am
doing well in my profession; in ten years’
time I shall be a rich man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I cannot wait for ten years,” said Barbara
slowly. “I don’t mind how poor you are,
Dick. I would marry you to-morrow if it were
not for mother. I don’t know how she will
get out of her difficulties. I cannot help her
in the way she wishes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They speak of you in connection with Selwyn,”
said the young man. “It is too awful.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, but there is nothing in it. Such reports
are sure to be spread of any girl. Listen
to me, dear. I will be faithful to you, but I
must not worry mother just for a little. Be
satisfied; let us understand each other, but do
not let the engagement become public quite
yet.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“I suppose it must be as you wish,” said
Pelham, “only I hate to feel that other men
have a right to talk to you, and make love to
you; but I suppose I must submit. Oh! if
only poor little Piers were not in existence,
your mother would welcome me. If I could
come to her as Sir Richard Pelham she would
raise no objections, eh, Barbara?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” answered Barbara slowly. “But as
Piers is there, and as we love him very much,
and as we earnestly hope he will live, there is
no use thinking of that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course there is not, and I am mad to
speak of it; but my brain is in a whirl to-night.
Yes; Piers will live—he will be a
strongman yet. He will come in for his sixty
thousand pounds a year and the Pelham estates.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is strange to think that you are really
the next heir,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a fact all the same, Barbara. If
Piers were not in the world, dear little chap,
I should be the baronet, and the property
would be mine. Well, don’t let us say anything
more about it. I suppose I must consent
to our not being engaged for the present,
but you must make me a promise.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me, here and now, that you will never
marry anybody else.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I promise never to marry any man in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>wide world but you, Richard Pelham,” said
the girl slowly and solemnly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot peered through the glass of the conservatory.
He could just see the faces of the
lovers. Barbara’s was all aflame with emotion.
Dick was holding both her hands in a fervent
clasp. With bowed head the surgeon moved
away. He had made up his mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hailing a hansom, he drove straight to the
house of the patient whose dying bed he had
promised to attend. It was now close on
twelve o’clock—the man had breathed his last
a quarter of an hour ago. Tarbot went into
the house, made ample apologies to the widow,
sympathized with her as she stood before him
in her grief, and then took his leave.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No time like the present,” he said to himself.
“My blood is up; I will not wait until
the morning. What I have to do I will do
quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Drive to Tottenham Court Road, and put
me down at the corner of Goodge Street,”
said Tarbot to his driver.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stepped into the hansom, the man
whipped up his horse, and a few moments later
the doctor was walking quietly down Goodge
Street. It happened to be Saturday night,
and Goodge Street at that hour was the reverse
of aristocratic. Torches were flaring on piled-up
barrows holding every sort of fruit. Women
were screaming and chaffering, men were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>lounging about and smoking, children got in
the way, were knocked over, and cried out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot in his light overcoat was a strange
figure in the midst of the others. One or two
people remarked him, a woman laughed, and
a girl came behind him and pushed his hat
over his eyes. A peal of laughter followed
this witticism. Tarbot did not take the least
notice, but walked on quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last he stopped at a corner house which
was different from its neighbors. It was
newly built, and looked clean and respectable.
It was, in short, a great block of people’s buildings.
He went up the winding stairs, and
presently sounded a bell on a door which was
painted dark green, and on which the number
47 shone out in vivid white. There was a
brass plate below the number on which were
inscribed the words—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Miss Clara Ives</span>,</div>
      <div class='line in4'><em>Trained Nurse, Medical, Surgical.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot waited for a moment. Would the
nurse be in? or, if in, would she have retired
to rest?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Scarcely that,” he muttered to himself;
“Clara does not sleep well. Clara has been
subject to insomnia; she will scarcely retire
before midnight on such a hot night as the
present one.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>These thoughts had scarcely darted through
his brain before the door was opened, and a
woman, tall and slender, with reddish hair and
a freckled face, stood before him. She was a
painfully thin woman, her eyes light blue and
her upper lip long.</p>

<p class='c010'>When she saw Tarbot there came a
gleam into her eyes—a peculiar look which
for a moment transformed them. Then she
stretched out her long right hand, took
hold of the doctor’s, and led him into the
room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who would have thought of seeing you
here, and now?” she said breathlessly.
“What do you want with me? Another case,
eh? or anything else?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want a good deal with you, Clara, as it
happens,” said Tarbot. He spoke in a familiar
tone, without a trace of respect in it. “Shut
the door, turn on the gas, and let us talk. As
I said, I have much to say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I am going out to a case in half an
hour,” said Nurse Ives. “I am packing my
things now—it is a bad case. A child has
been burnt, and they have sent for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Somebody else must attend to it. I want
you,” said Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Another case—one of life or death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have I ever spoken to you of little Piers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Pelham, the present owner of the Pelham
estates?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What, the child who comes between Richard
Pelham and the baronetcy?” said the
nurse eagerly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The same.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I have heard of him; he is a delicate
child. What of him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you undertake his case he runs a
chance of being a dead child soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now what does this mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It means that I want to revenge a wrong,
and the tool is young Piers Pelham. Do you
follow me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not at present, but I shall soon,” answered
the woman. Then she continued:</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the matter with the boy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At present,” said Tarbot, speaking very
slowly, “he is quite well, but within a few days
he will be ill. I shall send for you; you will
nurse him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And——?” said the woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot went forward and began to whisper
in her ear. Nurse Ives had a dead-white complexion.
As the doctor spoke, her face turned
ghastly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You want me to connive at a crime?” she
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot winced, then he said “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is this matter very important to you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is life or death to me—life or death.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>The surgeon rubbed his hands slowly one
inside the other; his eyes were fixed on the
eyes of the nurse. She looked back at him.
Then she spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will do what you require, on a condition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That you make me your wife.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That I marry you?” said Tarbot. He
started up. “That I marry you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>An ugly line, where she had been cut long
ago, came out across the woman’s temple. It
showed fiery red; the rest of her face was
dead-white. She laid one of her hands on
Tarbot’s; her hand was icy cold. He shivered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That you marry me,” she repeated; “that
you own me before all the world as your lawful
wedded wife. Only on that condition will
I do what you want.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot did not reply for a minute. He
turned away from the eager eyes of the nurse,
and closed his own. As he did so he saw another
vision—a vision of a girl in white. He
was carried away from his present surroundings
as he listened to a girl’s voice. The girl’s
face was a lovely one, and her voice like music.
She was saying solemnly, “I promise never to
marry any man in this wide world but you,
Richard Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am waiting for my answer,” said Nurse
Ives.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“Yes,” cried Tarbot, starting and opening
his eyes. “If you do what I require, if our
scheme succeeds, I will make you my lawful
wedded wife in the sight of Heaven.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>“THE KING CAN DO NO WRONG.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Sir Piers Pelham, aged seven, was an autocrat.
He lived in a big house, daintily and
luxuriously furnished. He had servants to do
his bidding; each whim was attended to immediately;
his mother was there to obey his
every dictate. He was the King in No. 12
Ashley Mansions. Nothing was too great to do
for him, nothing too hard to endure for his
sake.</p>

<p class='c010'>At present the little baronet was under the
care of guardians—his mother was one, a lawyer
of the name of Carroll was another, and
Luke Tarbot, one of the cleverest and most
rising doctors in Harley Street, the third.
When Piers came of age he would enter into
a property which represented over sixty thousand
pounds a year.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy’s father had died while hunting a
month before his birth. He had never been
the reigning baronet. The reigning baronet
was an old man, who had passed from life when
little Piers was a year old. From that time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the boy was Sir Piers Pelham. If he died the
title would go to Dick Pelham, who was his
second cousin.</p>

<p class='c010'>On a certain evening, about a week after the
events related in the last chapter, Luke Tarbot,
when he entered his house in Harley Street,
found a note awaiting him. It was from 12
Ashley Mansions, and ran as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Luke</span>,—I wish you would look round
as soon as possible. That new medicine you
have given Piers does not suit him. He is
feverish and unwell. The nurse has kept him
in bed to-day. He is not the least like himself.
I feel strangely anxious.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yours very truly,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>“<span class='sc'>Marion Pelham</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Having read the note Tarbot went into his
dining-room and rang the bell. His servant
answered his summons.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have dinner served at once, Peters,” said
his master.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man withdrew, and a few moments later
the doctor was enjoying an exquisitely cooked
meal. He was an epicure and always ate
deliberately.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having finished and enjoyed the refreshment
of a cigar, he put on his overcoat and
went to Ashley Mansions. The door was
opened by a footman in the Pelham livery.
The doctor asked for Mrs. Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“My mistress is in the drawing-room, sir.
She has been looking out for you very anxiously,
Dr. Tarbot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Announce me, please,” said Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>He left his hat and overcoat in the hall, and
a moment later was ushered into Mrs. Pelham’s
presence. She was a little woman, with rosy
cheeks and bright, dark eyes. She had the
eager, affectionate manner of a person whose
heart overbalances her mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am so glad to see you, doctor,” she cried.
“Please sit down. Piers has had a very queer
fainting fit this afternoon. I do not like the
state he is in at all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has the nurse come?” asked Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She came yesterday. I don’t much like
her, and I don’t think the child does either.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, she is an excellent nurse,” said Tarbot,
frowning; “one of the very best I have
on my staff. I’ll go up and have a look at the
child.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham took the doctor up-stairs herself.
The bedroom occupied by the small
baronet was luxuriously furnished in the style
best calculated to please a child.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just beyond it was a dressing-room, but the
little baronet slept, as well as played, in his
nursery. He was sitting up in bed now, with
flushed cheeks. He was a remarkably pretty
boy, with soft black hair, eyes dark as night,
and a velvety skin of the purest olive. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>moment his mother appeared he called out to
her in a high, ringing tone,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m better again, mother. Oh, is that you,
Dr. Tarbot? I don’t want any more of your
nasty medicines. You needn’t order them for
me, for I’m not going to take them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He laughed as he announced his determination.
The mother ran up to the boy and
began to kiss him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I do think he is a little better,” she
cried eagerly. She looked round as she spoke
at the nurse, who was standing perfectly
motionless by the bedside. The nurse did
not glance at her—her eyes were fixed on
Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I took his temperature an hour ago,” she
said; “he is decidedly feverish, and ought to
stay quiet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hate you, you nasty nurse,” said little
Piers, “and I hate you, too, Dr. Tarbot. I
want Dick to come to me—Dick or Barbara,
but I would rather have Dick. Do send Dick
to me, mother. He ought to come, oughtn’t
he, when the king wants him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think you should have visitors at
present,” said Tarbot. “I wish you to stay
quiet and to do what Nurse Ives says.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I’m not going to obey her,” said the
child. “I hate nurses. I want Dick. Please,
mother, send for Dick!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The doctor began to examine the boy, tapping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the little chest, listening to his breathing,
taking his temperature, feeling his pulse.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll be better soon,” he said, when he
stood up after making his examination. “I’ll
send you some fresh medicine; you need not
take any more of that bitter stuff. Nurse, I
will give you some directions in the other room.
Piers, listen to me—you must stay in bed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I won’t,” said the boy. “I’m going
to get up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll stay in bed, my boy, because I
order it,” said Tarbot in a determined voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy gazed at him out of his great black
eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You order it?” he said slowly. “I didn’t
think anybody could order Sir Piers Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And why not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, because—because I’m rich,” said the
child, “and I”—he gazed round him in a
puzzled way—“I’m great. I’ll be a <em>very</em> great
man when I’m grown up. I was telling nurse
about it. I was telling her that I’d have heaps
of money. I shall have everything my own
way. I’ll be a sort of king. The king can do
no wrong. That’s a beautiful proverb, isn’t
it? I’m going to have it illuminated and put
over the mantelpiece. I’m the king and I
can do no wrong, and I wish to get up, and I
<em>will</em>. You can’t keep me in bed, nor can nurse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may be a great king, or autocrat, or
whatever you like to call it,” said Tarbot,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“but you have got to obey me now because
I am your doctor. Nurse, I must speak to
you. I will see you afterwards in the drawing-room,
Mrs. Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The doctor and the nurse left the room.
The nurse was absent about five minutes.
She came back looking quiet and calm. She
went and stood by little Piers’s bed. The
mother was at the other side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think the doctor would like to speak to
you, madam,” said the nurse.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham left the room. She went
down-stairs. Tarbot was waiting for her,
standing with his back to the mantelpiece.
As soon as Mrs. Pelham came in he began to
speak.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t like the condition of the child.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She clasped her hands, and a look of terror
came into her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have discovered that there is real cardiac
mischief.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that?” asked Mrs. Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The child’s heart is seriously affected.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The mother uttered a cry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall call in Dr. Williamson to-morrow.
He is a great authority on such cases. We
must take his advice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham sat down on the nearest chair
and burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You might send for the child’s cousin,” said
Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“What cousin?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dick Pelham—he is fond of him. Anything
reasonable ought to be granted to the
boy at present.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham started up. “Dick shall come
at once,” she cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is right. I’ll call round in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot left the house. Mrs. Pelham sent
a hurried messenger for Dick. He arrived
within an hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, Mrs. Pelham!” he exclaimed, bursting
into the room, “what sad news is this?
What is the matter with Piers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is ill, Dick. The doctor says it is quite
serious.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you mean that Tarbot says so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, of course I mean Dr. Tarbot. He
always attends little Piers when he is ill. He
is his guardian, you know, Dick, or perhaps
you have forgotten. I hope you didn’t mind
my sending for you—the little fellow has been
calling for you all day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am delighted you sent for me. I’ll go
up to the boy at once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham ran up-stairs. Piers with a flushed
face was arguing with Nurse Ives. Nurse
Ives was making few replies. She was sitting
quietly by the child. Her eyes were fixed
steadily on his face. Little Piers turned away
from the bright glassy look in her eyes, then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>as if fascinated, he looked back at her. Dick’s
entry into the room made a diversion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hullo, Piers! what’s the matter?” said
his cousin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Cousin Dick, Cousin Dick!” said the
boy, “I am glad to see you. Come and sit
with me. I am glad, I am glad! You can
go away now, nurse, I want to be all alone
with my Cousin Dick: he’s my greatest friend.
He’s my heir, you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your heir?” said the nurse. “What do
you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; if I were to die, Dick would be Sir
Dick. Doesn’t it sound funny? Sir Dick!
You would, wouldn’t you, Dick?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t talk about it, Piers; I hate the subject,”
said Dick, frowning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wouldn’t make you angry for the world.
Come and sit near me and hold my hand.
Nurse, you can go out of the room. I love
you, Dick; I love you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what is the matter with you, Piers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My ticker beats too fast—it’s awfully troublesome—it
beats one, two, and it stops; then it
flies on, and then it seems scarcely to go at all,
and I feel cold and faint. If I were to get a
little worse, then you’d come into my property.
You’d make an awfully nice baronet. Give
me your hand, Dick. Sir Dick you’d be if I
were dead.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go to sleep, Piers,” said Dick.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>A <em>POST OBIT</em>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Pelham sat with the boy for about an hour.
The nurse came in and turned off the electric
light. She lit a lamp in a distant part of the
room, and shaded it; then she approached
the bedside on tiptoe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is the boy now?” asked Pelham in
a whisper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is very ill,” said the woman. “He
ought to have his medicine soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you won’t wake him for it,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sorry, but I must. The boy must
have his medicine regularly; it is a heart
stimulant.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, let me give it to him,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may if you like,” answered the nurse.
“Come into the dressing-room. I will give
you the glass, and you must raise his head a
little and whisper to him. He’ll open his eyes
and drink it, and then go off to sleep again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As the nurse spoke she opened a bottle of
medicine, measured out a dose carefully, and
gave it to the young man. He took it into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>sick-room, and, placing it on a table, bent
down over the little patient.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy was sleeping, starting now and
then in his sleep, now and then muttering a
word.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dick, I’m glad you are with me—I’d like
you to be Sir Dick, it would sound so pretty,
so pretty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wake up, Piers,” said his cousin. The
moment he spoke the child opened his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is time for your medicine, little chap.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I hate that nasty stuff,” said the boy,
shuddering and turning his head away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you’ll drink it for me because you are
a brave little lad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t want it, I’d rather die.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nonsense, Piers, folly!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But if I died you’d be Sir Dick.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I should hate it,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’d hate it?” said the boy. “Why,
you’d be the king then.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d hate it all the same. I want you to
live. I love you, little chap. Now open
your mouth, drink this off. Ah, that’s a good
boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The child swallowed the medicine.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It doesn’t taste like the last,” he said;
“it’s sticky and rather sweet. I’d rather have
the old medicine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sweet and sticky,” said Nurse Ives, who
came into the room just then. “It ought not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to be, for there’s nothing either sweet or sticky
in it. What do you mean, child? Give me
the glass, please, Mr. Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She dipped in her finger and tasted the
dregs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is queer,” she said. “I wonder what is
the matter with it. It ought not to taste like
this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She went out of the room, closing the door
after her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham paid no heed to her words. He
was not thinking about the medicine, he was
disturbed and anxious about Piers.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a time the child dropped off to sleep
again, and then the young man stole to the
door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am going away now, nurse,” he said. “I’ll
look in to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham went down-stairs. The drawing-room
door was open. Mrs. Pelham stood on
the threshold.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Dick, well?” she said eagerly.
“What do you think of him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think he is rather bad, if you ask me,”
said Pelham. “There is a great change in him.
If I were you I’d call in other advice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is what Luke thinks. He said we
ought to have another doctor. I am afraid he
thinks badly of the case.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d have in another doctor, and take him
out of Tarbot’s hands,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“What, give up Dr. Tarbot, the child’s
guardian! Dick, you are talking nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nonsense or not, if the boy were mine I’d
do it,” said Pelham. “I don’t like Tarbot. I
never pretended to. I don’t like that nurse
either.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But Dr. Tarbot says she is the very best
nurse on his staff.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All the same I don’t like her. I’d have
somebody else, and I’d have a new doctor.
That is my advice, but of course you won’t
take it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I couldn’t, my dear Dick. I couldn’t offend
Dr. Tarbot. It would be madness. Oh,
what a confused, helpless state I feel in—my
darling child, my only one! You don’t think
that he is in danger?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I don’t go so far as that,” said Pelham.
“I’ll call in again in the morning, and I’ll send
Barbara round.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He loves Barbara, he would like to see her,”
said Mrs. Pelham. “Give my love to her,
Dick. Dick, is it true—are you engaged to
Barbara?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, worse luck,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you say worse luck?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because we cannot marry. I am as poor
as a church mouse, and she has nothing. But
there, Mrs. Pelham, I am a selfish brute to talk
of my own affairs just now. I hope little Piers
will be better in the morning. Good night.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>As soon as Dick had gone Mrs. Pelham
went softly up-stairs. She opened the door of
the sick-room and stole in. The boy, excited
and restless, heard her. He called to her to
come to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t sleep, mother,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is he worse, nurse?” asked Mrs. Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, madam, nothing of the kind,” said the
nurse. “Kindly leave us, madam, you are
only exciting him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, you had better go away, you are only
exciting me,” repeated Piers. “I want Dick to
stay with me. You are too anxious. I hear
it in your voice. Please go away, mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham went very slowly out of the
room. When the last echo of her steps had
died away Nurse Ives locked the door. She
then turned on the electric light.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you doing now?” asked the sick
child, raising himself on his elbow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean to send you to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Like you did last night?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, like I did last night. Didn’t you like
it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was a little—afraid,” said the boy very
slowly. He looked anxiously round the room—“I
wish—Dick were—here,” he said again,
“or—or mother. I was very much <em>afraid</em>.”
And now his eyes, luminous and troubled, were
fixed upon the cold, inscrutable face of the
red-haired nurse.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“There is nothing to frighten you, child,
quite the contrary,” said the nurse. “You
must just lie quiet and fix your eyes on me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t want that bright light,” said the
boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind the light—don’t think of it. I
want to send you off to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why don’t you give me something to send
me to sleep? When mother had bad toothache
the doctor gave her something out of a
bottle and she went to sleep. I wish you’d
give me something out of a bottle. I don’t like
to go to sleep your way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mine is a much, much better way. Now
you’ll do what I tell you. Give me both your
hands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I—I <em>won’t</em>!” said the child, struggling and
beginning to cry feebly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am going to stroke your forehead quite
gently, and you shall look in my eyes. Don’t
look away. See, I’m going to comfort you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy fidgeted and tried to shut his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Open your eyes, Piers, look at me this
minute,” said the nurse, in a firm, stern voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I—I won’t!” began the child. He looked
away, then he looked again; soon he looked
steadily, his own eyes full of fear. Gradually
the fear went out of them, the eyes became
fixed and strained. The nurse sat in such a
position that the boy had to look up a little as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>he gazed at her. Meanwhile she stroked his
forehead gently, calmly. Soon a change came
over the face, the eyelids closed, the color left
cheeks and lips; the nurse put her finger and
thumb on the little wrist—the pulse had apparently
ceased to beat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s all right,” she said to herself. “I
didn’t study under Dr. Weismann in Paris for
nothing. Ha! ha! my dear Doctor Tarbot,
you think I am your tool, but how do you
know that I shall not turn the tables on you?
Poison this boy, indeed—not I! I mean to
save him, poor little fellow! I shall save him,
and win you. I shall feather my own nest,
and hold such a weapon against you that you
will be in my power for the rest of your life.
You made a mistake when you asked a woman
as wise as I am to assist you.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can I ever forget the day when Dr. Weismann
performed a similar experiment on a
young man in the hospital, and then called in
the most eminent physicians to examine him;
didn’t they one and all pronounce him dead?
You are not cleverer than Dr. Weismann, or
the other great Paris savants. I am your
match. You will rue the day you consulted
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The nurse laughed softly to herself. Meanwhile
she watched the patient. The child
looked no longer like a patient; he looked no
longer like any living creature—the pallor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>death was on his forehead. To all appearance
he had ceased to breathe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nurse Ives sat motionless by his side for a
couple of hours. At the end of that time she
went up to a wicker-work trunk which stood
in a corner of the room. It was a trunk of
somewhat novel shape, being longer than those
usually employed. She opened it, and took
out an electrical apparatus. She put this in
order, and applied a powerful current to the
child, placing one pole at the side of the neck,
and the other over the heart. In a few moments
little Piers opened his eyes slowly, and
gazed up at his nurse with a tranquil expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have had a nice sleep,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>She smiled at him, bent forward, and kissed
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must have some nourishment before
you go to sleep again,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>She put away the electrical apparatus, returning
it to its place in her wicker-work
trunk. She then heated some beef-tea and
brought it to the child’s bedside.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Drink it off, dear,” she said. The child
drank it greedily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did put me into a nice sleep,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, am I not a wonderful woman? Now
go to sleep again, little one, and I will sit by
you. But listen to me, Piers—you are not to
tell anybody about my secret.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“What secret?” asked the boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The beautiful way in which I put you to
sleep.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would you rather I didn’t?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should be very, very angry if you did.
You must not disobey me. Do you promise?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes, I promise; but don’t look at me
with such queer eyes; you make me frightened.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have no cause to be frightened; go
to sleep again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile Pelham, hailing a hansom, drove
straight to his chambers in Temple Court.
He entered his sitting-room, and then started
back with an impatient exclamation. Tarbot
was standing on the hearth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sorry you cannot give me a welcome,
Pelham,” said the other man. He came forward
as he spoke, and held out his hand.
“Have you been to see little Sir Piers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” answered Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What did you think of him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He seems very weak. I don’t much like
his state.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, we’ll pull him through,” said Tarbot,
speaking in a cheerful tone. “I am glad you
went to see him; he has taken a great fancy to
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We were always the best of chums,” said
Pelham shortly. “Take a chair, won’t you?
Can I do anything?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“That’s a civil way of asking why I take the
liberty of calling. The fact is, I have come on
a matter of great importance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham remained motionless. He had not
seated himself, but stood on the hearth where
Tarbot had stood a minute or two before. His
blue eyes were fixed upon Luke Tarbot’s face.
The surgeon gazed straight up at the young
man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you are engaged to Barbara Evershed,”
Tarbot said abruptly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; but how do you know?” Pelham’s
face was crimson.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are engaged to the girl I meant to
marry. You must forgive me if I fail to congratulate
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham’s blue eyes wore a stormy expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is an awful blow to me, but all the
same, for the sake of the girl, I want to help
you. I know more about Mrs. Evershed than
you have any idea of. She is in serious difficulties.
Although you are engaged to Miss
Evershed, you have not a chance of marrying
her, because you are a poor man. Miss Evershed,
as far as I can make out, will not allow
the engagement to become public. That is
an awkward thing for you. You would like
to have everything straight and above board,
would you not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That goes without saying,” answered Dick.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“But excuse me, Dr. Tarbot, I can scarcely
understand——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My object in taking any trouble in the
matter?” continued Tarbot. “It never occurred
to you, did it, that there might be such
a thing as disinterested love?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are not the man to do anything noble
without an object.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are unfair to me, Pelham, and I shall
prove to you that you are in the wrong. Mrs.
Evershed’s difficulties are most serious. Between
her and ruin there is but a step. Now,
it so happens that I can help her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can help her—how?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the loan of a sufficient sum of money
to put her straight with her creditors for a considerable
time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then for Heaven’s sake do it, Tarbot. It
would be a generous action.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And why, according to your own showing,
should Luke Tarbot be the man to do a generous
action?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again Pelham was silent. Tarbot took a
step forward. Pelham looked him full in the
eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You want to say something. Say it
quickly,” he cried. “To be frank with you,
Tarbot, there are some men whom I like, and
some——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For whom you have an antipathy,” said
Dr. Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Pelham nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then in that case all is fair and above board
between us,” said Tarbot. “We both want the
same girl; we have both fought for her. You
have won and I have lost. The loser in the
game has seldom an admiration for the winner,
but all the same, for the sake of this girl,
I will help you to do a generous thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot bent forward and said in a low tone,
“I will lend Mrs. Evershed ten thousand
pounds on condition that you pay me back on
the day you come in for the Pelham estates.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham’s face turned white.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Exactly what I say. I will lend you that
sum to help Mrs. Evershed on that one condition
and that alone. You will have, of course,
to sign a <em>post obit</em>, but such things are done
every day. On the day you come in for the
estates, worth over sixty thousand a year, you
will pay me back that trifling loan. Are you
willing to oblige Barbara’s mother, or are you
not?”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>“I HAVE MISJUDGED HIM.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Two or three days later Pelham received a
note from Barbara Evershed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dearest Dick, come and see me at once,”
she wrote. “Something most wonderful and
unexpected has happened.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham, who was just attending to his first
brief, started up with an exclamation, put on
his hat, and in half an hour had arrived at Mrs.
Evershed’s house in Mark Place. He was admitted
at once, and ran up to the drawing-room,
where Barbara was waiting for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear old Dick,” she cried, “I am about
the happiest girl on earth!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what has happened? I never saw you
look so excited before.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have reason to be excited. We can be
engaged now quite openly. Oh, how happy
I am!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And so am I, Barbara, if it is true; but has
your mother given her consent?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, it is all right now. Everything has
come right, and in such a wonderful, marvelous
way.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“Tell me the story.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must begin at the beginning. You know
I hinted to you about poor mother’s money
difficulties?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Barbara.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, they are all put right; and so suddenly,
so unexpectedly. And who do you
think has done it? Why, Dr. Tarbot—the man
I almost hated. He has lent mother ten thousand
pounds, and on such easy terms that it
will be possible for her to repay it all by
degrees.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He says he doesn’t mind when the capital
is returned, and she is only to pay four per
cent. interest. You can’t imagine what a relief
it is. The poor dear had been getting into
most awful trouble, and those horrid money-lenders
were getting her into their clutches.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She told me only yesterday that unless I
engaged myself to Lord Selwyn—(Dick, Dick,
think of it, that old horror! that dreadful,
withered-up old creature!)—she said that unless
I could bring myself to accept his proposals
she would have to try to borrow money from
the Jews, and they would charge twenty or
thirty per cent. interest. She said we might
keep on for another few weeks and then we
must go under.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Dick, if it hadn’t been for you, I must
have yielded, for, after all, she is my mother,
and I love her dearly! She spoke of the awful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>scandal, the disgrace, the debts, the angry
creditors, her appearance in a public court.
Oh, it nearly broke my heart!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There, don’t cry, my dearest girl,” said
Pelham, for Barbara, overcome by her emotions,
had laid her head on his shoulder and burst
into a passion of tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am all right now,” she said, quickly recovering
herself. “It is over, and Dr. Tarbot
has done it all. He is our blessing, our good
angel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham was silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It happened last night. Mother and I had
a long conversation, and at last I told her I
would think over matters, and let her know
my decision within an hour. I never meant
to yield, Dick, so you need not look at me so
reproachfully, but it was my only chance to
gain time, and just then Dr. Tarbot was announced.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I went out of the room, for I did not want
to see him. Little I knew what he had come
about, ungrateful girl that I was. He and
mother sat together and had a long, long conversation,
and I went up to my room. I
thought everything was lost. And then at last
I heard Dr. Tarbot go. The next instant mother
rushed up-stairs, opened my door, came up to
me, and clasped me in her arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Darling, darling, we are saved!’ she cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘What can you mean?’ I answered.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“‘It is all Dr. Tarbot’s doing; he has proved
our good angel,’ said mother. ‘He will lend
me ten thousand pounds within a week from
now. Oh, Barbara, he is doing it so handsomely,
so splendidly!</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Barbara child, you ought to marry him.
He loves you, he told me how he loved you;
he said it was on your account he was doing
it. He didn’t press that you should engage
yourself to him. On the contrary, he seemed
quite hopeless about it. But, Barbara, he is a
man in a thousand.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I am greatly obliged to him,’ I said. ‘I
think he is quite splendid; I didn’t know it was
in him; but, mother dear, I cannot show my
gratitude in that way—I can never marry him.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘My darling, he makes no conditions. He
said you were not to be persecuted on his account.
I almost think he would have preferred
your not knowing that he has behaved so well
to me. Now, Barbara, you queer girl, have
you nothing to say to me, no secret you are
keeping from me? I have rather suspected it
for the last few days.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dick, that was my opportunity. I could
not help it—I burst out with everything. I
told mother all about my great, great passionate
love for you. She was so kind to me, and
so relieved about her money affairs, that she
consented to my becoming engaged to you.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She even said she thought Dr. Tarbot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>would like it. Just imagine it, Dick! Could
you for a moment have believed that it was in
that man to be so generous? Oh, how bitterly
I have misjudged him! I should like to go
on my knees to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, mother told me I must write to you
early this morning, and ask you to stay to
lunch, and we can be engaged now before all
the world. As soon as you have a little home
for me, Dick, however humble, I will come to
it with delight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To this exciting narrative Pelham made
short replies. He said he was very glad, but
his enthusiasm with regard to Tarbot was not
what the girl had expected. On the contrary,
whenever Tarbot’s name was mentioned Pelham’s
face became grave and stern.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the matter, Dick?” said Barbara
at last. “Why do you look like that?—you
have such a queer expression in your
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have I, Barbara? I ought to have a
delighted expression—the thought of winning
you is enough to make any man happy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But are you not grateful to Dr. Tarbot?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t question me. I have an unreasonable—no,
perhaps it is not unreasonable—but I
have a very strong dislike to him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Surely that is unkind. I own, until yesterday
I quite shared your feeling, but how can
I think it any longer? I almost believe that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>could love him. At least I must tell him how
very grateful I am for what he has done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham looked stern.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dick, what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t say too much about him, Barbara.
I must tell you plainly that I do not like this.
It seems to me as if I owed you to Tarbot’s
action. It all sounds very generous, but then
you are not behind the scenes. I don’t want
to be in debt to Tarbot for anything. Oh,
there, there, dear,” for Barbara’s face had
clouded and then became very white. “It is
all right now, and it <em>is</em> a blessed relief, and
we’ll be married as soon as we can, little
woman. I was attending to my first brief
when your fascinating little note arrived.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I rushed off to you, of course, for what
are briefs to me when you want me? But
now I shall attend to business with a will. I
have about three hundred a year of my own—a
mere nothing, of course—but we might
be married in the autumn. We could begin
in a small way, and hope for the time when I
shall earn enough to give you the comforts you
ought to have, my darling.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t want comforts, or luxuries,” said
Barbara. “I just want to be with you. Yes,
we’ll be married in the autumn, Dick. I don’t
wish to wait. I don’t care how poor you are.
Oh, that is mother’s step. Now, Dick darling,
be kind to her, she has gone through a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>deal. Money troubles are enough to take the
heart out of any one. Be very nice to her,
dearest. Be as grateful as you can.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As Barbara uttered the last words the drawing-room
door was opened and Mrs. Evershed
came in. She was a handsome woman, tall
and stately. There were hard, worn lines
round her mouth, but her relief was expressed
in the eyes, which were still shining as if
through recent tears, and in the mouth, which
smiled, notwithstanding its tenseness. Pelham
went up to her eagerly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is what Barbara tells me true, Mr. Pelham?”
said Mrs. Evershed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is perfectly true,” replied the young
man. “I love Barbara with all my heart.
She has promised to marry me, but we should
both like your consent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That means,” said Mrs. Evershed, “that
you would marry without it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should,” was the quick response; “but
I doubt whether Barbara would yield to my
entreaties.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know what I should have done if
I had been tried,” said Barbara, “but luckily
it is not necessary. Mother consents, don’t
you, mother—you consent to make me happy
in my own way?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, my child, I cannot refuse my consent.
I have been relieved of a great load of
care, Mr. Pelham, and it behooves me to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>good to others. I may as well say frankly that
I had more ambitious views for Barbara, although,
of course, I like you personally very
much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As Mrs. Evershed said the last words she
held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I give my consent, Dick,” she said softly.
The young man grasped the hand she offered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are more than good,” he said. “You
make me happier than I have words to express.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, come down and have lunch with
us now. I shall have much, of course, to talk
to you about afterwards. Yes, I allow the
engagement, but the marriage need not take
place for some time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We can talk that over by and by, mother,”
said Barbara. “Come, Dick; come to lunch.
I am so hungry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They had just assembled in the dining-room
when there came a ring at the front door, and
a moment later Tarbot appeared. He entered
the room hurriedly, shook hands with Mrs.
Evershed, nodded to Pelham, and then approached
Barbara’s side. When she saw him
her face grew white. She looked round her
eagerly; the servant had withdrawn. She
held out both her hands then and clasped
Tarbot’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must thank you here and now,” she said.
“I do so with a full heart. I did not know it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>was in you. You are the most generous man
in the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A queer look came into Tarbot’s face. His
eager eyes looked into the girl’s; they glittered
with suppressed emotion. He tried to
say something, but no words would come.
Barbara’s girlish thanks unnerved him. Pelham
was watching him intently. The next
moment the little party were seated at the
luncheon table.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just as the servant was handing an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</span></i>,
Tarbot glanced at Mrs. Evershed and spoke
quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is very sad about Piers Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What about him?” asked Mrs. Evershed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham dropped his knife and fork. Barbara
looked up with interrogation and alarm
in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sorry to say that the child is dangerously
ill. I have been obliged to consult
Williamson. He thinks badly of the case.
All depends on the next few days, but at the
present moment his life hangs in the balance.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE KISS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Late in the afternoon of that same day,
Barbara Evershed called at 12 Ashley Mansions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is Sir Piers?” she asked of the servant
who opened the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very ill, miss.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is Mrs. Pelham at home?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man knew Barbara, and invited her to
enter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am quite sure Mrs. Pelham will be glad
to see you, Miss; she has mentioned your
name once or twice to-day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will find her myself,” said Barbara;
“don’t come up-stairs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl ran quickly up the richly carpeted
stairs, and a moment later knocked at a
door. A voice said “Come in,” and she entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham started up when Barbara appeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I am glad to see you,” she exclaimed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“Come over here, sit down near me. Have
you heard the—the news?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The widow’s lips trembled, and her eyelids
were red from weeping.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The news about Piers?” said Barbara.
“Oh, I don’t believe for a moment it is so bad.
Dear Mrs. Pelham, don’t give way; try, try
to bear up.” For the poor woman had suddenly
flung her arms round Barbara’s neck
and burst into a passion of convulsive weeping.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is dying!” she exclaimed. “He has
such dreadful fainting fits. The doctors say
that there is no hope. There were two of
them here this morning. They say that in all
probability little Piers will be dead before
many days are over. Oh, Barbara, I am glad
you have called. It seems a queer, wild thing
to say, but I do believe you can save him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I! What do you mean?” said Barbara,
coloring vividly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has been often asking for you and Dick—he
loves you both so much. Do you know,
Barbara, I have taken a most terrible dislike
to that red-haired nurse?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is she a trained nurse?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, the one Dr. Tarbot insists on having.
She belongs to his special staff. Sir Richard
Spears, as well as Mr. Williamson, called to-day.
I said something about having in a
second nurse, but Dr. Tarbot said at once that
it was not necessary.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“You ought to do what you please,” said
Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is a very determined man, Barbara,
and I dare not oppose him. It seems to me
as if I had not the management of my own
child, and it is hard, bitterly hard. Oh, I
cannot believe that my darling is leaving me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think it <em>can</em> be true,” said Barbara.
She stood upright. All the happiness which
had filled her eyes left them, and her face
looked grave and older than her years.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think God can mean little Piers to
die,” she repeated. “I am sorry you do not
like the nurse, for so much depends on nursing
in cases of bad illness. May I go up to
see Piers now, Mrs. Pelham?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my darling, I wish you would. I have
a feeling that you can save him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall only be too delighted to go and sit
in the room and do anything the nurse says.
I have always been fond of Piers. He has
been like a little brother to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Barbara, I shall die if my only child is
taken from me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he may be spared,” exclaimed Barbara
eagerly. There was hope in her young
voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham dried her tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go up and see him, Barbara,” she said.
“Go now, at once; the nurse may try to prevent
it, but insist on seeing him. He ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>not to be left alone with that strange woman,
and she never likes me to be long in the room.
Children have got better, haven’t they, even
when the doctors have given them up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Over and over again,” said Barbara. “Yes,
I’ll go up at once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She left the drawing-room and ran up-stairs.
She knew Piers’s beautiful room well, and
softly opened the door. Within was darkness.
A woman in full nurse’s dress confronted the
girl.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you want? You must not come
in here,” said Nurse Ives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My name is Evershed,” said Barbara, dropping
her voice to a very low tone. “I have
come to see Piers. I am one of his greatest
friends. I have known him all his life. May
I come in and sit with him for a little? I
should like it so much, and I would be quiet.
I would do just what you wished.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You cannot come in,” said the nurse. “I
cannot permit it. No stranger is to be allowed
to come into the room. I am acting on the
doctor’s authority.” As Nurse Ives spoke
Barbara found herself edged, against her will,
on to the landing. A very weak voice inside
the room called her name—“Barbara!
Barbara!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, he heard my voice; he wants me.
Do—do, nurse, let me go to him—please,
nurse.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“I cannot,” said the nurse. “Stay where
you are for a moment. I will go back to him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She reentered the room and said something
to the child which Barbara could not hear, and
returned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You cannot see the boy—I have Dr. Tarbot’s
orders. Now please go away. I must
return to him immediately.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As the woman spoke she went back to the
sick-room and shut the door in Barbara’s face.
Just for a moment the girl lingered on the landing,
then a resolved expression filled her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will not let me in without Dr. Tarbot’s
permission. Then I will go and obtain it,” she
said aloud. “I will see Piers, come what
may.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She ran down-stairs. Mrs. Pelham met her
on the landing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?” she said eagerly. “Did you see
him? What did you think of him? Was the
nurse very unpleasant? Oh, Barbara dear, I
shall go mad if nothing is done! Oh, if I could
only get that woman out of the house!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She seems a good and capable nurse,” said
Barbara. “Don’t get too nervous, please, Mrs.
Pelham. The boy is ill, and I should like beyond
anything to be with him. No, dear, she
would not let me see him. He heard me,
and called me, the darling; but she would not
let me in. I have made up my mind, however.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>I am going straight off now to get Dr.
Tarbot’s permission. If he says I may see
Piers, it will be all right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s splendid, Barbara! Do go at once.
It is so queer that the only person who is
allowed freely to see the dear little fellow is
Dick. Dr. Tarbot does not mind Dick being
with him, nor does the nurse, and Dick calls
every day. He will be here soon. It is the
greatest possible comfort to me to have the
dear fellow about the house. He is almost
like a son of my own. You know, dear, how
much I have always loved him. Oh, and you
are engaged to him, Barbara. Yes, I know;
the report has reached me. He will be a husband
in a thousand. I am glad you are going
to be happy with him some day. Yes, when
Dick comes he will sit with Piers, but he does
not often come until late, and if you could be
with the darling until Dick arrives I should not
be nearly so anxious.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, hope for the best now, dear Mrs.
Pelham. I will go off at once to see Dr.
Tarbot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara ran down-stairs. Ashley Mansions
was within a stone’s throw of Harley Street.
In less than five minutes she was standing on
the steps of Dr. Tarbot’s house, and the door
was immediately opened in answer to her ring.
She asked if Dr. Tarbot was in.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Miss,” replied the footman.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“I want to see him immediately.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man invited her in.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What name?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say that Miss Evershed has called. Say
also that my business is of an urgent nature.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man showed Barbara into the dining-room
and withdrew. A moment later Tarbot
entered the room. He came forward eagerly,
his thin lips twitching, his eyes full of subdued
light.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To what am I indebted for this pleasure?”
he began.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara interrupted him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want to ask you a great favor, Dr. Tarbot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish to sit up with little Piers to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>On hearing these words the expression on
Tarbot’s face altered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you mad?” he asked, looking full at
the girl.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; I am sane.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know anything whatever of nursing?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t want to nurse—there is a professional
nurse to do that. I want to stay with
the child, to hold his hand, to be with him.
It is unkind to leave him with strangers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Evershed,” said Tarbot suddenly, “I
would do much for you, you know that.” The
look in the doctor’s eyes became eager, and
Barbara shrank towards the door.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“I would do much for you,” he continued,
“but where my professional duties are concerned
I have no choice. I would rather that
the nurse had the entire care of Piers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I cannot see any reason for this,” said
Barbara, clasping her hands. “Besides,” she
added eagerly, “you allow Dick Pelham to be
with him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pelham is different. He has been with
the boy from the first. It would be unkind to
turn him out of the room, but your face would
be a fresh one. The child’s condition is most
serious. Any extra excitement might stop the
heart which is so dangerously affected.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can I not induce you to grant my request?
Little Piers called out for me when I went to
the door just now—he heard my voice. Is not
happiness good for sick people? Is not happiness,
and a little bit of their own way, quite
as valuable as your most potent drugs? Oh,
I believe such to be the case—I am sure I am
right. Dr. Tarbot, do allow me to have my
wish. It cannot possibly injure Piers for me
to sit with him, and I am always quiet and
never excitable. It would make him happy!
Please grant my desire.”</p>

<p class='c010'>While Barbara spoke, the eager light in her
eyes, the tremulous movement of her beautiful
lips, her young figure all alive with the sympathy
and longing which filled her soul,
brought to Tarbot a moment of mad brief temptation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>His own eyes glittered. He came
close to the girl.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You want this favor badly?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I grant it, will you do something for
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Need you ask?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will grant your wish on a condition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot’s face grew white. He came still
closer to Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?” she asked impatiently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I allow you to sit with little Piers to-night
will you—<em>kiss me</em>?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara staggered and caught a chair to
steady herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An hour ago I thought you a good man,”
she said at last slowly. “I was mistaken. I
cannot sit with Piers on those terms. Good
night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot quickly recovered himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Forgive me! Forgive me!” he cried. “I
was mad for a moment. It is your fault.
Why are you so beautiful, so lovable? Oh,
Barbara, you could have made a good man of
me, and now I am”—he breathed the words
low—“a devil! But forgive me. Come, I
will go back with you. You shall have your
wish. I grant it without any condition. I will
accompany you to Ashley Mansions and take
you into the sick-room.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara said nothing. Her first impulse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>was to go straight home to her mother, but
thoughts of Piers and of the benefit she might
do him caused her to change her mind. She
walked quickly back to Ashley Mansions with
the surgeon, neither of them speaking a word.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham was waiting by the drawing-room
door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is all right,” said Barbara, nodding to
her. “Dr. Tarbot will allow me to stay with
Piers to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank God!” answered Mrs. Pelham.
“I am greatly obliged to you, doctor, for this.
Barbara, dear, Dick is up-stairs. He arrived
almost immediately after you left. There
seems to be some commotion in the sick-room.
I heard steps hurrying about, but I am too
frightened to go and inquire. Go and tell me
quickly if anything is wrong.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara nodded, and the girl and the doctor
went up-stairs. When they reached the threshold
of the room Tarbot turned and looked
full at Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say that you forgive the impulse which
came over me half an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara hesitated; then her words came
out, very low.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will—try.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come this way.” Tarbot opened the door.
The two passed beyond the screen. The room
was no longer dark—it was lit up with brilliance.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Pelham and Nurse Ives were both standing
by the bed. When Pelham saw Barbara he
uttered a cry. Nurse Ives looked at the doctor
and nodded to him to come forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the bed lay a little figure perfectly motionless,
and as if carved in marble.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE CAUSE OF DEATH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Barbara tried to hurry forward, but Tarbot
pushed her aside. He bent over the child and
examined him carefully. The boy was absolutely
unconscious and icy cold. He looked
exactly like one dead. Was he dead? Barbara’s
heart beat so hard that she fancied it
must be heard. She had never seen death
before. Did it look like that?—was there
always that absence of all movement, that queer
gray look on the face? Already it seemed to
Barbara that she scarcely knew little Piers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot did not speak for a moment; then he
turned to the nurse.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How long has the boy been in this state?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not long—about a quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me what occurred.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara, scarcely able to control herself, had
walked to the window. She now came forward
and stood at the foot of the bed. Pelham
had placed himself close to the little motionless
figure, and once or twice his hand touched
the boy’s clustering dark curls. Nurse Ives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>faced the doctor. She held herself erect.
The electric light lit up each feature. Her
harsh face, her red hair, her pale blue eyes,
and the ugly red scar across her forehead were
all distinctly visible.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara shuddered as she looked at her.
Was it possible that a woman like that had
attended the sweet little child during his last
hours? The girl found herself shivering from
head to foot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me how this happened, nurse,” said
Tarbot in a gentle voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As you know, doctor,” said the nurse, “the
child has been subject to bad fainting fits.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The stimulants had a certain effect on the
heart,” continued Nurse Ives, “but the improvement
always passed away quickly. Notwithstanding
the large amount of nourishment
he took, the boy was thoroughly exhausted.
Miss Evershed came up on the landing and I
went to speak to her. The boy heard her
voice and got into a state of excitement, too
much for him in his feeble state. I did not
dare to allow her to come in. When he found
I would not admit her he began to cry, and I
was just repenting of my own determination,
when to my great relief Mr. Pelham came into
the room. When he saw the child he put his
arms round him and raised him slightly on his
pillow.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“‘You must not move him too much,’ I
said; ‘in the state of his heart the least exertion
is bad.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bad!” exclaimed Tarbot. “In the condition
the child was in, the slightest movement
might have proved fatal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham’s face, already white, now looked
ghastly. He ceased to touch little Piers’s curls.
With his arms flung at his sides, he turned
and faced the doctor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“May I continue the story?” he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly,” said Tarbot, turning and facing
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought the boy very bad; I noticed how
weak he was and the blue look round his lips.
I asked the nurse if he ought not to have some
medicine. She told me that his medicine was
finished, and that the chemist had not yet sent
a fresh supply. I then asked her to give him
brandy. She brought some. I endeavored
to put a little between his lips. Nurse came
up and watched me as I did so.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘He ought to have the proper medicine,’
she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She asked me to fetch it. She gave me
the address of the chemist, and I rushed off.
I was absent about ten minutes. When I
came back with the medicine the boy was
looking very queer and white. Nurse took
the bottle into the dressing-room and I accompanied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>her. She poured out a dose and
gave it to me. She stayed in the dressing-room
while I went back to the room. The
light was dim, for the boy complained of it
hurting his eyes. I raised him up and managed
to get the medicine between his lips. I
had scarcely done so before nurse came back.
She said he ought to be better now, that the
medicine was a very strong heart stimulant
and ought to act immediately.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I told her I did not think it was doing so.
It seemed to me that the child’s breathing was
becoming slower and slower. I touched his
forehead and it was cold. I looked round at
the nurse.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Is anything the matter?’ she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I do not like the condition of the child,’
I said. The moment I said so she started up,
switched on the light and bent over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Go down-stairs and fetch up some more
brandy,’ she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ran down. I did not want to frighten
Mrs. Pelham, and I could not find the butler
immediately. I had to go down to the kitchen
premises in search of him. This caused a
delay, and I was not back in the sick-room for
two or three minutes. When I returned the
child was in his present condition. How
dreadfully bad he looks! What is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot made no reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>He bent again over the child. Once again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>he held the pulseless wrist between his finger
and thumb; once again he listened at the cold
still heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara and Pelham now stood side by
side at the foot of the bed. Having made his
brief examination, Tarbot stood up and faced
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The king is dead! Long live the king!”
he exclaimed. He held out his hand to
Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham turned white as death.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dead! What do you mean?” he exclaimed.
“The child cannot be dead. I don’t
believe it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look for yourself,” said Tarbot. “What
does this mean but death? The heart has
ceased to beat, the body is already turning
cold. I will see the child again within a few
hours, but in my opinion he is dead. I—you
will allow me to congratulate you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Dr. Tarbot,” cried Barbara, “you
cannot say such awful words now! Congratulate
Dick! Congratulate Dick! What do
you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She began to tremble. Pelham put his
arm round her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come out of the room,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the landing Barbara’s self-control completely
forsook her. She began to cry in a
terrified, painful sort of way. Tarbot heard
her sobs and went out.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“Now, this is wrong,” he said, speaking in
his most professional manner. “Of course it
is all terribly sad, but Dr. Williamson and Sir
Richard Spears and I expected the child’s
death. His heart was terribly affected. Had
he lived he would never have been strong,
and would have suffered much. Although he
was rich, his life would not have been a happy
one. I did not think death would have been
quite so sudden, but—— By the way, Miss
Evershed, can you control yourself?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will try to,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you do something for me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you break this terrible news to Mrs.
Pelham?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I cannot, I cannot,” said the girl, trembling
and covering her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That means that you will not? You are,
I know, a brave woman. Ought you to think
of yourself in a moment like this?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl colored; then drew herself together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You do right to remind me,” she said.
“I would not be a coward for the world. If
you think it right, I will go to her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do. I knew you had plenty of pluck.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara glanced up at Pelham. There was
an expression on his face which she had never
seen there before. It puzzled and terrified
her.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“Go, dearest,” he said, bending down and
kissing her on the forehead. “Go. God help
you! God help us both!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara ran down-stairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pelham, this is a grand thing for you,”
said Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I forbid you to speak of the change in
my prospects to-night,” said the young man
impetuously. “I cannot stand this—it all
looks——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The least said, soonest mended,” said
Pelham. “I am in no fit state to speak to any
one now. I will leave you, Dr. Tarbot. I can
do no good here. I will come back in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He rushed down-stairs, and the next instant
let himself out of the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot remained on the landing a moment;
then he returned to the boy’s nursery. Already
over the features of the child that look
of repose had crept which only death is supposed
to give. The nurse was beginning to
lay out the little body. She now stood still
awaiting the doctor’s directions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Death has come rather sooner than I expected,”
said Dr. Tarbot. “It was doubtless
due to shock—the shock which caused death
was the sudden appearance on the scene of
Sir Richard Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The nurse stood up and stared full at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Tarbot. She made no reply. There was a
scornful expression round her lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is best that we should talk in this
strain,” said Tarbot, dropping his voice. “I
repeat, the shock which caused death was the
sudden appearance on the scene of Sir Richard
Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think so; the boy was fond of
his cousin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was; but love is too mighty an emotion
when life ebbs so low. We should never
have pulled him through. Well, nurse, it is a
fine thing for Sir Richard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I fail to understand you,” said the nurse.
Then she added significantly, “I have done
my part well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Admirably.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will keep your part of the bargain?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you will give a certificate of death?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For the sake of appearances, I should like
to see the child again in the morning, but I am
as sure that death has already taken place as
that I am now talking to you. In the morning
I can write the certificate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What cause will you give for death?” asked
the woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Collapse from cardiac failure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall stay here to-night,” said Nurse
Ives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do so, nurse. I should wish you to stay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>for the next day or two, as you will probably
have to look after the mother. She is certain
to be terribly prostrated; I am going to her
now. I sent Miss Evershed to break the news
to her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is a kind girl, a fine girl,” said Nurse
Ives. As she spoke she raised her eyes and
fixed them on Tarbot’s face. Her glance took
him by surprise. He looked away, and a dull
red crept into the woman’s face. She tightened
her thin lips, and there came an ominous
gleam in her pale blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is Sir Richard here?” she asked after a
moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, he has gone. By the way, nurse, don’t
throw away that last bottle of medicine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You had better take it with you, Dr. Tarbot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I will not do that. Leave it where it
can be got when the moment arrives. Put it
into the cupboard and lock the cupboard.
Mrs. Pelham will not change the arrangement
of the room for some time. I shall write a
certificate of death in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Once again Tarbot strode up to the bed
and looked at the body. The child was now
faintly smiling with that ineffable smile of peace
which death seems always to give. Heaving a
brief sigh of satisfaction, Tarbot turned on his
heel and left the room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE LONG TRUNK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was certified that Piers Pelham, baronet,
aged seven, had come by his death owing to
cardiac failure. The certificate to this effect
was duly signed by the well-known Dr. Tarbot,
one of the cleverest and most rising doctors in
Harley Street. The great specialists who had
been called in to see the child expressed no
surprise when they heard of the death; only
one of them remarked that he did not think the
end would have come quite so soon.</p>

<p class='c010'>In other quarters there was a certain amount
of gossip. Dick Pelham was considered wonderfully
lucky. Before the child’s death he
had been a mere nobody—a briefless barrister
with the ordinary chances of a moderate
success. Now he was a man of vast importance—the
baronetcy was one of the oldest in England,
and the acres which belonged to the title
large, fair, and widely spread.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham’s engagement to Barbara Evershed
had just been bruited abroad in society, and
she was heartily congratulated. The whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>thing was almost like a story. Nothing could
have happened in a more opportune way. Of
course, the death of the child was dreadful, and
those who knew the little fellow were heartily
sorry; but few people did know him, and
Barbara had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amongst these people the general rumor
was that the child had been removed at a most
crucial and happy moment. Mrs. Evershed’s
monetary affairs would be put straight, and she
would be the mother-in-law of one of the richest
men in England. The match was a splendid one
for her handsome daughter. Yes, Barbara was
in luck, but as she happened to be a popular
girl, as the voice of society pronounced her
fine-spirited, and even noble, there was not
one who grudged her the happiness which was
now assuredly to be hers.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to the mother of the dead boy, the terrible
shock had brought on a sharp attack of
nervous fever. A nurse had to be called in to
look after her. As a matter of course, Nurse
Ives had been asked to undertake the case, but,
much to Barbara’s surprise, she absolutely refused
to nurse Mrs. Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot do it,” she said. “I will stay in
the house until another nurse arrives, but I do
not wish to have anything to do with the
case.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot was much annoyed at this decision,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>but he could not shake Nurse Ives’s resolve.</p>

<p class='c010'>Forty-eight hours after the death of the child
his coffin arrived. The undertaker’s men
brought it into the room. Nurse Ives was the
only one present. The men lifted the little
body from the bed and laid it in the coffin.
They then turned to view their work.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He makes a pretty corpse, don’t he?” said
one to the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>In truth he did. His face was like a flower,
for the color had not quite left his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’d a’most fancy he was alive still,” said
one of the men. “See that touch of pink?”
He touched the cheek reverently. Nurse Ives
went up and stood at the head of the bed. She
gave the man an angry glance and he apologized
for what he had done.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will come in if you like later on to
screw down the lid,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The lid had better be screwed on now,”
said the nurse. “There are signs of mortification
already setting in, and it would be unwise
to leave the coffin uncovered any longer. Miss
Evershed or Mrs. Pelham might come up to
see the corpse; it would not be safe, and I
wish to have the lid screwed on at once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, Miss, we’ll soon put things
straight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The men put on the lid and screwed it down,
and then they went away. The moment they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>did so a queer look came over Nurse Ives’s
impassive face. She went quickly to the door
of the room and locked it. Then, taking a
turnscrew, she hastily unfastened the screws
and removed the lid from the top of the coffin.
Having done this, she lifted the body out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Once again she laid it on the bed, and now
she piled warm blankets over the little body,
and put a hot bottle, which she had previously
got ready, to the feet. Then, going to the
dressing-room, she brought away a small box
which contained capsules of amyl nitrite. She
broke one of the capsules in a handkerchief,
and, holding it close to the nostrils of the
child, a strong and pungent odor filled
the room. The face of the dead underwent
no perceptible change at first, but then
the faint color in the cheeks increased. A
look of triumph filled the nurse’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good!” she cried. “It is all right. I
thought I could do it, and I have. Dr. Tarbot
imagined he would be even with me. He is
not; I am his master. What is about to happen
to-night will come upon him as a blow
when he least expects it. Yes, all is well; I
feather my own nest; I receive that reward
for which I have lost my soul. I prepare for
the evil day. I know what I am about.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As these thoughts flew through the woman’s
mind she went over to the wicker trunk at the
other end of the room and opened it. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>trunk was of a peculiar shape—much longer
than is ordinarily made. From this receptacle
she took out bales of cotton wool and several
iron weights. She wrapped the wool round
the weights and filled the coffin with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>When she had put in enough wool and iron
to make up the probable weight of the child,
she screwed on the lid again, and having done
so, bent over the little body. The color was
still in the cheeks, although the cheeks were
cold, and the eyes remained firmly shut. Not
a breath passed the lips, not a movement was
apparent; still, the woman felt quite satisfied.
She gave a further sigh of intense relief, and
throwing an eider-down quilt over the blankets,
left the room, taking good care to lock the
door of the chamber of death after her. She
went the entire length of a long corridor and
paused outside Mrs. Pelham’s room. The
other nurse had arrived and was already in
charge. Barbara Evershed was standing near
the door. Barbara had seen the undertaker’s
men bringing up the little coffin, and her eyes
were red from a fresh burst of tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall leave to-night,” said Nurse Ives,
pausing and looking full into the girl’s face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you see Mrs. Pelham?” asked
Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will not be necessary; but if she wishes
I will go in and say good-by to her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sure she would like it; but first a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>word. Nurse, I saw the coffin brought up-stairs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, my dear, yes,” said Nurse Ives. She
did not touch Barbara, but she looked at her
with a curious expression. “The coffin has
arrived and I put the child in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should like to see him once again,” said
Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You cannot. The lid is screwed on the
coffin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara’s face flushed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Was that necessary?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; it was indispensable. I will speak
to Dr. Tarbot on the subject when he next
calls. It would not have been safe for you to
see the little corpse again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara was silent for a moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You had better come in and say good-by
to Mrs. Pelham,” she said then.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nurse Ives entered the room. A moment
later she stood by the sick-bed. Mrs. Pelham,
with her cheeks flushed, her eyes bright, a
strained, piteous expression round her trembling
mouth, looked up at the nurse.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is that you, Nurse Ives?” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sorry you are going to leave me. I
like to feel that the one who has been with
my darling at the last is now with me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For some reasons I am sorry to go, madam,
but it is impossible for me to stay. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>will wish you good-by now. Nurse Hester
will do all she can for you—will you not, Nurse
Hester?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The strange nurse nodded but did not trouble
herself to speak. She did not like Nurse
Ives, and she was not going to conceal the
fact.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham held out her trembling hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-by,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>The nurse turned and left the room. Barbara
followed her on to the landing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall go in a couple of hours,” said the
nurse. “I am only waiting to see Dr. Tarbot
and to pack one or two of my things. Ah, I
think I hear the doctor’s step on the stairs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman stood in the shadow, and the
doctor, without seeing her, entered the sick-room.
He stayed there for a few moments
and then came out again, Barbara accompanying
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is that you, nurse?” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir. I have waited to speak to you.
I should like to say a word before I go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, I can attend to you now. Good
night, Miss Evershed. I hope you will go to
bed and have a good sleep. Nurse Hester
can look after the patient. There is nothing
to be alarmed about in her condition—she is
suffering from shock and fever. These symptoms
will soon pass off.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara reentered the room, and Nurse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Ives and Dr. Tarbot walked down the passage
together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you have quite made up your mind to
go?” he said to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I leave to-night. I thought I ought
to tell you that I had the coffin screwed up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed! Is that not rather soon?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Unmistakable signs of mortification have
already set in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then in that case you did right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought you ought to know,” said the
nurse, dropping her eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly. You acted with discretion.
It would never do, were such the case, for
Miss Evershed to be bending over the child’s
body. Girls have so much false sentiment in
a thing of that kind. The poor little fellow is
now far beyond the reach of any sympathy
which earth can give him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is what I thought, doctor. Well, I
shall leave to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shall I order a cab for you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, thank you; I will go out later on and
see to that myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well, nurse. Good-by. I shall
find you at your old quarters, eh?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will not undertake a new case at
present?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall never undertake a new case; you
understand our compact?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“I am not likely to forget. I will call to
see you to-morrow evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The doctor ran down-stairs and let himself
out of the house. Nurse Ives went softly
back to the room where the child who was
supposed to be dead lay. Having entered,
she locked the door. She remained in the
room for a few minutes and then went down-stairs.
The footman was in the hall.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you going out, nurse?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; but I shall be back in an hour.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We shall all be glad to retire early to-night,”
said the man. “I, for one, am dead
tired.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course you are, and you need not sit
up. I am leaving to-night, but not yet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then, of course, one of us must stay up to
see you out?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is not necessary. If you leave the
door on the latch I shall let myself out, and I
have a latch-key with me. I have a little
business to transact now, but will be back
again. I shall desire a cab to call for me when
I am ready. Go to bed, Thomas. I can manage
for myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man nodded, and the nurse left the
house. She hailed a cab, and drove straight
to her own rooms in Goodge Street. She
made certain preparations there, and then left
the house. The same cabby brought her back
to Ashley Mansions.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“I shall want you to wait,” she said to the
man. “I shall be leaving very soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She had been absent nearly an hour, and
it was now close on twelve o’clock. When
Nurse Ives came in again the house was quiet;
Barbara, worn out, had retired to her own
room. The servants, only too glad of the
early hours after the late excitement, had retired
to theirs. Nurse Hester sat with the
sick woman. Mrs. Pelham was very restless.
Sleep would not visit her. She insisted on
holding Nurse Hester’s hand, and the nurse
could not leave her for a moment. Nurse
Ives knew exactly what was likely to take place,
and had made her plans accordingly. At midnight
she lifted the boy from the bed, and
opening the wicker trunk, laid him in it. He
was a little fellow and very slender; the trunk
was long, and the boy fitted in comfortably.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having done this, Nurse Ives stole down-stairs
on tiptoe and motioned the cabby to
leave his horse and enter the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want you to move a trunk down,” she
said. “Will your horse remain quiet while
you are away?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes; there’s no fear of him,” answered
the man. “You haven’t much luggage, have
you?</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, only the one trunk, and it is not
specially heavy. Go up-stairs as quietly as
you can.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>The man did so. He lifted the trunk on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a queer shape,” he said to the woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a very convenient shape,” she answered.
“Skirts of dresses do not get creased in a trunk
like that. I had it made on purpose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man hoisted it on his shoulder and
went quietly down-stairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>He put the trunk on the cab, and Nurse Ives
shut the door of 12 Ashley Mansions behind
her. At about half-past twelve she reached
her own place. The cabby carried the trunk
up-stairs for her and laid it inside the room.
The lamp was lit here, and the gas stove was
burning brightly. On the table in the center
of the room was something covered with a
white cloth. Nurse Ives paid the cabman,
who withdrew.</p>

<p class='c010'>The moment he did so she lifted the covering
from the instrument on the table and proceeded
to open the trunk.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE DEAD RESTORED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Nurse Ives lifted the little body out of the
trunk and laid it down on a pile of warm
blankets in front of the hot fire; then, taking
the electric battery from the table, she proceeded
to put it in order and applied it to the
side of the child’s neck and over the region of
his heart, just as she had done before in Ashley
Mansions. On this occasion, however, the
electric current was far more powerful.</p>

<p class='c010'>The nurse watched the child with keen
anxiety as she used this means for his restoration.
At first the strong electric current
seemed to have little or no effect; then gradually
the color, which had been restored to the
child’s cheeks when the amyl nitrite had been
applied, deepened and the eyelids quivered
very slightly. At last the eyes were opened
just for an instant and then closed again.
When this happened the nurse ceased to apply
the current, and, rushing to the table, prepared
a hypodermic injection of ether. This was
quickly injected into the child’s arm. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>effect was instantaneous—a gentle glow pervaded
the whole of the hitherto icy frame and
the little body quivered from head to foot.</p>

<p class='c010'>Once again the boy’s eyes were opened, and
now it was quite apparent that he was breathing,
although very faintly. Nurse Ives began
gently to rub the limbs with her warm hands.
Stooping low, she breathed with her own hot
breath into the child’s mouth. His breath was
now coming calmly and steadily.</p>

<p class='c010'>She once again applied the current, and the
boy began to stir. Then she lifted the arms
above the head and put them down again, performing
by this means artificial respiration.
The child now looked steadily at her. There
was a dreamy, unconscious film over the
bright, dark eyes; but he was awake, alive—no
longer a corpse. He was a living boy once
again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nurse Ives took the little wrist between her
finger and thumb—the pulse was working, but
somewhat shakily.</p>

<p class='c010'>She did not dare to lift the boy yet into a
sitting position. She allowed the full influence
of the fire to pervade his icy frame, and occasionally
she still applied a gentle current of
electricity.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a time she put away the instrument,
and, kneeling by the child, put into his mouth
a few drops of very strong soup mixed with
brandy. He swallowed a little. She felt the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>pulse again. It was steady, stronger, less intermittent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where am I?” asked little Piers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“With me, my dear little man, quite safe.
Don’t talk now; you are weak. I am going
to give you something nice to eat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am—<em>awfully</em> hungry,” said the child.</p>

<p class='c010'>The nurse knelt low by his side. She fed
him by drops. She had made up her mind
that the child should live. Her exertions were
rewarded. She thought of nothing else at the
moment, her soul was filled with pure gladness.
She even forgot Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They all think that he is screwed up in his
little coffin—that he is dead, dead, dead!” she
said to herself, “and yet I have him here alive
and well. It was a terrible experiment, but it
has succeeded. I have saved him from the
hands of a wicked man.” She clasped her
hands, fell on her knees, and covered her face.
“And yet I love that man,” she cried with a
groan.</p>

<p class='c010'>She trembled all over. The boy called her,
however, and she had to exercise self-control.
Hour by hour he was now getting rapidly
better. Not only did he recover full consciousness,
but he seemed stronger than before
the long trance to which he had been subjected.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a wonderful case,” thought Nurse Ives.
“More wonderful even than that case which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>excited so much remark in Paris when I was
with Dr. Weismann. I am the cleverest
woman in England—I have brought the dead
back to life. You will do now, my little man,”
she said aloud, looking at the child as she
spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy was gazing at her intently. He
was sitting up; he looked quite strong, and
there was color in his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where am I?” he asked. He gazed
anxiously round the queer little room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are on a visit to me, I am taking care
of you. I am your nurse. Don’t you love
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you aren’t my real nurse,” said little
Piers. “What folly you talk! You’re only
the woman who came in to nurse me when I
was taken ill. Where am I? I want to go
home to mother and to Dick. Where is Dick?
He was the last person I saw before——” The
child began to shudder and tremble.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it, little one? Don’t look like
that. What is troubling you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take me in your arms, nurse,” said the
child.</p>

<p class='c010'>The nurse seated herself on a low rocking-chair and lifted the boy into her embrace.
His face was deadly white again, the faint trace
of color having left it, but his eyes, large and
beautiful, were fixed with wonder in them on
the nurse.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“Are you,” he said, speaking very slowly
and with pauses between, “the same woman—who—used
to nurse me when—I was—very ill—at
home?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You had red hair?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t like you then.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, dear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But”—he glanced up at her—“your hair
isn’t red now: it’s gold, and I <em>like you</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lay your head on my breast, little man.
I am so glad you like me. I like you, too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The child’s dark head fell upon the woman’s
breast, and a moment afterwards he sank into
a gentle sleep.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’ll do, he’ll live,” she muttered. “Luke
Tarbot, what a sell for you! He’ll live, he’ll
live! Thank God! Yes, I can manage everything
my own way now. Luke thought himself
cleverer than I. I am playing my own
game, and this”—she glanced at the child—“this
little fellow is the ace of trumps.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nurse Ives presently lifted the boy and
carried him into the next room. She undressed
him and lay down beside him, taking
him in her arms. The child slept during all
the night, but the woman lay awake. She was
too excited to sleep—she was a desperate
woman, and she was playing a desperate game.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the morning the child awoke, looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>much better. He was now lively and full of
questions, anxious to go home, talking frequently
about his mother, about Barbara and
Dick.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why are you keeping me here?” he said
to Nurse Clara, but though he asked the question
he was not in the least alarmed. He was
only seven years old: a precocious boy of his
age; but at seven our faith is large, and we
believe, as a rule, what is said to us.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the following day Nurse Ives did
not dare to leave him. While she watched
him, and played with him, and chatted and
got him to tell her his innocent thoughts, she
was turning over a weighty problem in her mind.
It would, she felt certain, be madness to confide
her secret to another, and yet she knew
that if she married Tarbot, as she meant to do
almost immediately, she must get some one to
help her in the care of the boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Early in the evening Nurse Ives took the
child in her arms and rocked him off to sleep.
He was wide awake when she began and
resisted her efforts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t stare at me,” he said, beginning to
shudder. “I don’t like it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She took no notice. She did not mean to
mesmerize him again after to-night, but to-night
she must do it. It was all important
that he should remain absolutely quiet during
Tarbot’s visit. She fixed her eyes on his face.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Soon his bright dark eyes looked steadily into
hers, and a curious look came into them. He
closed them in a few moments, repose settled
down over each feature, his breath came softly
and gently. She carried him then into her
little bedroom, put him in the bed which she
had previously warmed, and, putting a nightlight
in a distant corner, softly shut the door.
He was mesmerized into a tranquil sleep, not
in the least resembling the cataleptic state in
which he was the night before. Nurse Ives
now felt certain that the child would sleep
undisturbed during Tarbot’s visit.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>“DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was nine o’clock when Tarbot arrived.
Nurse Ives was waiting for his step. If he
lifted the little knocker on her door and
sounded a rat-tat the child might awake.
Accordingly, the nurse kept the door open.
Once or twice she went out into the passage
and looked over the banister. Tarbot’s steps
would be distinctly heard upon the stone
stairs, and it was necessary to bring him into
the room as quietly as possible. He was a
man who invariably kept his appointments to
the minute. Nurse Ives was certain he would
come about nine o’clock, and he verified her
belief by arriving two minutes after the hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha, nurse!” he said when he saw her.
She had dressed herself for the occasion, and
with great care. She had changed her nurse’s
dress for one of blue velvet, of a deep rich
tone of blue, the gift of a former patient. It
suited the woman well, bringing out the best
points in her face and figure. She wore
ruffles of real lace round her throat and wrists;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>her hair she had managed to dress with skill,
fluffing it out and making the most of it. Its
redness now became a positive beauty.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nurse Ives knew the necessity of striking
while the iron was hot, and of making in every
respect as good an effect as possible. Having
attended to her own person and made it as
attractive as she could, she next turned her attention
to the little room, which now appeared
almost pretty. The gas stove burned brightly,
the atmosphere was warm, but not too warm.
On the center table was a lamp with a rose-colored
shade. The disfiguring gas, which
always tries the prettiest face, was not lit.
The light round the table was rosy. Nurse
Ives sat in this warm glow; it softened her
features, rendering them almost beautiful.
She was very pale, but the rose light gave
her just the right touch of color. The red
mark on her forehead was hidden by the
cunning way in which she had arranged her
hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the first glance Tarbot scarcely knew
her, but at the second he recognized her. In
his heart of hearts he disliked her all the more
for dressing up in velvet and trying to assume
the manner and appearance of a fashionable
woman. He knew well why she did it, and
he said to himself that he was paying a terribly
heavy price for his revenge. He was beginning
already to repent, but he was not a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>ever to turn back. He held out his hand to
the nurse now, and entered the room with a
cheery step.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did capitally,” he said. “Capitally!
No one could have managed better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To hear him speak, one might have supposed
that he was congratulating the nurse on
having brought a patient back from the borders
of the grave. She took his cue, and
replied in much the same tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Having pleased you,” she answered, “I
have nothing further to desire.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As she spoke she raised her light blue eyes
to his face. She longed for him to kiss her.
Unscrupulous as she was, for him she felt a
passion which in itself was pure and strong
and holy. She would have given up her life
for him. If he had in any degree returned
her love she would have been faithful to him,
no matter whom else she destroyed. Provided
he did not provoke her jealousy, she would
in her way make him an excellent wife, but
with such a woman as Clara Ives jealousy
could make her as cruel as the grave.</p>

<p class='c010'>She motioned the doctor now to an easy
chair and sat down at a little distance from
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you eat?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have just dined.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can I get you anything to drink?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“Then I will shut the door. We have
much to arrange, have we not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, nurse. We can talk over the progress
of events and all that is likely to follow, but
not to-night, nurse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara Ives held up her hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you stop me? What is the matter?”
said Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“From this moment,” she replied, “we drop
that word nurse. It signifies servitude, and
I’m a servant no longer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’re both servants to the noble cause of
science,” said Tarbot with a light laugh. “It’s
no disgrace to be a servant, my good creature.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is no disgrace,” answered Nurse Ives.
She rose to her feet, then suddenly fell on her
knees. She was close to Tarbot now, and,
stretching out one of her hands, she clasped
his. It had been lying in his lap, and he had
not time to withdraw it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I long to be <em>your</em> servant,” she said, and
she kissed the hand which she held.</p>

<p class='c010'>He laid the other for a moment on her head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did not know you had such good hair,”
he said. “It is thick and abundant. It suits
you arranged like this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not really thick, but I puffed it out
by artificial means. I am glad you like it. I
did the best for my appearance for your sake.
I know I am not beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All the same, you look well in that dress,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>he answered. “Dress can do much for
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It shall do much for me, Luke.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He suppressed an involuntary shudder when
she called him by his Christian name.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It shall do much for me,” she repeated.
“You will never be ashamed of me when you
see me at the head of your table.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He did not reply, but started restlessly from
his chair and stood with his back to the gas
stove.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This room is hot,” he said. “Do you
mind opening the other door?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I would rather leave it closed. I like
to keep my bedroom cool. The air from the
gas stove gets into the room and overheats
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As you please. You must not keep me
long now. Things have turned out exactly
as we planned.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said the woman. “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did what I required admirably—no
one better. By the way, have you any of the
hyoscine left?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The nurse’s face grew very white.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A little. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You had better give it to me—it is safer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nurse Ives rose and went into the other
room. She soon returned with a small bottle
which contained some white powder. Tarbot
slipped the bottle into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“Pelham is in the toils,” he said grimly.
“You are prepared to swear that he was alone
in the room with the child when he took the
last dose?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am; but need we enter into the subject
now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no. You look worn out. Are your
nerves troubling you, nurse?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They are a little. I am overdone. I did
not think I should find it so hard. I did it for
your sake, remember. I have imperiled my
soul for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A sneer crossed Tarbot’s lips. He did not
reply at all to this statement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When is the funeral to be?” asked the
nurse.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On Saturday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman gave a shudder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are trembling. I must give you a
tonic,” said Tarbot with some anxiety.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not need any tonic. I shall be all
right when the funeral has taken place—that
is all. Where is the child to be buried?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the family vault in Devonshire. There
is a chapel attached to Pelham Towers, and a
consecrated graveyard—the vault of the Pelhams
is there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>An involuntary smile crossed the woman’s
face, and she turned her head aside.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you going to attend the funeral?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“Mrs. Pelham wishes it. I would do anything
to please her—poor soul.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara Ives smiled again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the matter with you?” Tarbot
continued. “When I speak of the funeral of
a child who has died in his babyhood, a child
whose life meant much and whose mother is
broken-hearted, it seems strange that you
should smile.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are hidden nerves which one cannot
always control,” said the nurse with an air
of wisdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, come, Clara, you need not talk science
to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course not. You know a great deal
more than I do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And yet you are very well informed for a
nurse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is true. Remember, I was with Dr.
Weismann in Paris for a year.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was a clever man, but a humbug.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We need not say anything more about it
now,” said Tarbot, rising.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We need not,” she answered. “I know a
little science, a smattering which comes in
usefully on occasions. When I am your wife
you will perhaps instruct me further.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you eager that I should do so—to lift
the curtain more, to study the awful, the terrible
problem?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Apart from your love, that is the one and
only subject which fascinates me,” replied
Nurse Ives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, well, our tastes agree in this matter.
You have quite made up your mind not to
take another case?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have told you so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems a pity. I must be going now; I
will look in again in a few days.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall not take another case, and you must
not go away just yet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must. I have a patient to see at ten
o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your patient will have to wait.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear good Clara! I, a doctor, keep a
patient waiting! You forget yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; but you, Luke, forget yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I fail to understand you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You shall not leave here,” said the woman.
She drew herself up—she was tall and slender.
“You shall not leave here until our wedding
day is fixed. Luke, what day will you marry
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He gave a shudder, and this time it was
perceptible. An ugly expression crossed the
woman’s face, and the red scar became visible
even under the cloudy mass of hair. She
raised her hand impatiently and pushed back
the hair. As a nurse, she always wore it
smooth and plain, and in its fluffy condition it
worried her.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“I keep you to your bargain,” she said.
“You promised to marry me if I did what you
required.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And, of course, I keep my word,” he answered.
“But why speak of marriage just
now? We can surely wait for a short time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We cannot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean that you are to marry me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did I not say I would?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Luke, if you could but love me!
Luke, bad as I am, I would make you a good
wife. Bad as I am, I could be good to you.
After all, are we not both outcasts? Are we
not both separated from the rest of the world
by the crime we have committed?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush!” said the man. His face looked
ghastly. “How dare you talk like that?
There are subjects which even between man
and wife”—his lips trembled—“must not be
alluded to. I did what I did because—Heavens!
we cannot talk of it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We need not talk of it, but you <em>know</em> what
we both have done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t listen to you. What is it you want?
There are things which upset the strongest
man’s nerves. You, Clara, are coarse. You
are not a lady; you have been trained in
hardness; you have no highly-strung nerves.
It is terrible to be highly educated. It brings
torture.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“Aye, I can guess that. You had best
make me your wife. I can keep those disordered
nerves of yours in check. When the
time comes, I shall know how to soothe you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I may not tell you now. After you have
married me you will not regret it. When is
the wedding day to be?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When do you wish for it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“First, Luke, answer me one question.
Have you the very slightest love for me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you want me to tell the truth or a lie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, what folly this is!” cried the woman.
“A lie! I should soon detect it. The truth,
man, and nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then this is the truth—I do not love
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought as much. Luke, when is our
wedding to be?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You make a proposal, Clara, and I will see
if I can yield to it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We can be married by special license,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Special license! Why throw away fifty
pounds?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We can be married by special license,”
repeated Nurse Ives; “so the wedding can
take place this day week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So soon!” said Tarbot. “Impossible!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not impossible, Luke. Do you consent?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“I must if you wish it; but it must be quite
private.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will go to church on the morning of
this day week, and afterwards we can go for a
fortnight’s honeymoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It would be very awkward my leaving
London just now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Awkward or not it must be done. You
can get a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">locum tenens</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well; if I must, I must. I did not
know you would be so exacting.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are to be married, then, this day week
by special license, and——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Privately married, remember, Clara. There
is to be no fuss. A busy doctor cannot afford
the time. We marry, and I take you away
for a fortnight.” The man’s lips trembled. He
turned aside. He was paying a price which
nearly maddened him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nurse Ives kept on gazing at him fixedly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have more to say,” she continued.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At the end of the fortnight you bring me
to your house in Harley Street, you introduce
me to your friends as Mrs. Tarbot, your lawful
wife, you take me into society, and you publish
our marriage on the day it takes place in every
daily newspaper in London.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, Clara, this is too much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You promise all this or I——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You what?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“I deal you a blow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot was standing up. He staggered
slightly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What kind of blow? You are not going
to turn traitor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t say what I am going to do. I did
what you wished. It is your turn now to fulfil
your side of the bargain. If you refuse you
will repent it. If you accede to my wishes I
will help you to carry out your revenge. Remember,
at present you have only committed
the crime, but the pleasure which is to follow
has not begun. Are you going to deny yourself
that for which you blackened your soul?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Remember, I shall make you an excellent
wife. I shall stimulate you to greater exertions
in your career. There will be no nerves
about me, no stepping back because of conscience,
or any such humbug. When your
foe falls, I shall for your sake rejoice. I know
the woman whom you mean to hurt and crush
and dishonor. She is the woman whom you
now love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whom now I hate. Don’t dare to mention
her name.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will mention it, and now. Her name is
Barbara Evershed. I understand exactly what
your revenge means. It is the most diabolical
scheme ever planned by human brain, but I
will help you to carry it out.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“Clara, you are a terrible and extraordinary
woman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have not yet half gauged my wickedness
or my powers. Do not make me your
enemy. You will only repent that deed once,
but that will be forever. Make me your wife,
and you shall have a splendid time. Is it to
be or not to be?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I said I would marry you, but some of
your terms are preposterous.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They must all be carried out. Marry me
in a week from now. After the marriage we
go away for a fortnight’s—bliss.” She paused
here and looked him full in the face. He made
an effort to return her gaze, but his eyes, bold
and inscrutable as they were, fell before hers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is diamond cut diamond,” she said slowly.
“You have your match in me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe I have.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You accede to my terms?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do because I must.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s right. Get your house in order, or
stay—do nothing special. I should like to refurnish
when I take possession. You can go
now, Luke; you need not come here again
unless you wish to. The less you are seen
here now, the better for our future safety. I
will meet you at whatever church you appoint
on the morning of this day week. If you are
true to me, I will be true to you; if not—I have
you in my power.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Having seen Tarbot out, Nurse Ives returned
to her own room and sat down in front of the
gas stove. It was a warm night—warm and
damp. There was a thick fog outside, one of
those fogs which are the first forerunners of
autumn. But, warm as it was, the woman felt
cold. She held out her two thin hands to the
warmth of the stove, then, suppressing a shudder,
she got up and went on tiptoe into the room
where little Piers Pelham was lying fast asleep.
He slept soundly, and he looked beautiful—there
was an angelic smile on his small face.</p>

<p class='c010'>A queer, new expression came over the
woman’s face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why am I stirred when I look at him?”
she said to herself. “Why does my heart beat
so fast? If he were my very own I do not
think I could love him better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then she returned to her seat in front of the
stove. She was a temperate woman, and although
she felt faint and overcome she would
not have recourse to stimulants. She prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>herself a cup of cocoa. It was hot, and it
comforted her. It took away a curious craving
which she could not quite account for.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am hungry, and yet not hungry,” she
said to herself. “I feel terribly excited. I
have gone through much, and it is wearing me
out. This day week I shall be his wife—I shall
be Mrs. Tarbot. There is a good deal to be
done in the time. I must get suitable clothes.
Above all things, I must supply myself with
plenty of underlinen, fine and beautifully embroidered.
I shall get a lot of handkerchiefs,
too, of the finest lawn, and every one of them
shall be embroidered, not marked in ink, but
embroidered in satin stitch with the name,
‘Clara Tarbot.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To think of my name being Clara Tarbot!
I the wife of Luke Tarbot, the great brain
specialist of Harley Street! Oh, I do well, I
do very well for myself. I won’t think about
any future—I do well for myself for the present.
The boy’s life is safe, and I shall get my heart’s
desire. This day week he and I will be married.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder where we shall go for our honeymoon.
Imagine my having him for a fortnight
all to myself! How will he bear it? If he
had any love to give me he might like it, for I
have power, strength. I am in no sense a
nonentity. I can flatter, I can please, I can
excite him, and I can also soothe him. I vow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>that he shall come under my influence. I
know a way by which I believe I can gain a
wonderful power over him. I will use it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That girl shall be wholly forgotten. Plain
as I am, I am the woman to whom he will
come in his hour of trial. Yes, there is no
doubt I have a great future before me, but in
the meantime there is much to be done. A
few pretty dresses, or, rather, handsome dresses,
have to be bought, and, above all things else,
the boy has to be cared for. Now, what am I
to do with the child?”</p>

<p class='c010'>This problem occupied Nurse Ives during
the remainder of the night. She had been up
for several nights now, but she did not feel
sleepy. She thought and thought, and towards
morning it seemed to her that she had solved
the difficulty.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is the best thing I can do, and I must
do it,” she thought. “What is a mother for
but to help a daughter? Yes, I will do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Having made up her mind, she went and lay
down beside the boy. The soft breath of the
child, who was now fast returning to his normal
state of health, mingled with hers, and she
clasped the dimpled fingers of the little one.
As she did this, once again that queer indescribable
drawing, which she did not recognize
as love, began to awaken in her heart. She
crept close to the lad and took comfort in his
presence.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“I am so glad I saved him,” she said to herself.
“When all’s said and done, I am not
such a villain as Luke—Luke, the man I love,
the man I would die for.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At last she fell asleep, wearied out, and awoke
about ten o’clock. The boy was sitting up in
bed. He was hungry, and there was a slightly
fretful expression on his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you sleep so long?” he said in a
peremptory tone. “I’m not accustomed to
being kept waiting for my breakfast. Why
didn’t you wake up in proper time? I’m very
hungry. I want my breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll get it for you at once, little one,” said
the nurse. “Stay where you are; I’ll dress
you afterwards. I’ll bring you your breakfast
in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nurse Ives rose hastily, and without even
troubling to smooth her hair or change her blue
velvet dress, went into the other room. Having
set the kettle on to boil, she came back.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How smart you are, nurse!” said the
child.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you like my pretty frock?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I like it awfully. You won’t wear that
ugly nurse’s dress any more, will you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t intend to. I’m not going to be a
nurse any more, little Piers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, my love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do get me my breakfast—I’m so hungry.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“It’s coming, dear. I have set the egg on
to boil.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nurse Ives returned to the other room and
prepared a dainty meal. She brought it to
the boy on a tray and sat by his side while he
ate it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You look much better,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m quite well,” he answered with a laugh.
“It’s wonderful how much nicer I feel in this
queer, poky little scrap of a room. I was
awfully ill when I was at home. I never felt
anything like it. Nurse, did you ever seem
to be going through the floor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, dear, I can’t say that I have.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have felt it, and it’s awful. The feeling
began to come just when you arrived. I used
to have it about once a day at first, but lately
it seemed to be always coming. I was always
going down, and down, and down, and then
jumping up again, and then at last——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, dear; tell me what you felt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I heard Barbara’s voice, and you wouldn’t
let her in. I called out to her, but you
wouldn’t let her come. Then I cried, for I
love her better than any other woman in the
world, except mother, but you sent her away;
and I felt so dreadful. I went down, and down,
and down ever so far, and it seemed to me that
Barbara would save me, but you wouldn’t allow
her to come in. You were awfully cruel then.
You didn’t wear your pretty blue velvet dress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>then. Oh, you were terribly cruel. I thought
about your cruelty, and the feeling of going
down got worse and worse. I thought at last
that I must be sinking right through the earth,
and that perhaps I’d come out on the other
side, where it’s day, you know, when it’s night
with us. Oh, it was awful!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t talk of it any more, Piers—it is over.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I like to tell you. Dick came into the
room—dear Dick, I was glad to see him. You
know, nurse, he is very strong, and I like to
have him with me. He put his big strong
arms round me, and then I didn’t sink any
more, at least, not at first, but at last even his
arms didn’t seem strong enough, and I began
sinking away from them, and then you sent
him out. Oh, why did you send him away?
You could have gone for the medicine yourself.
I called after him, but my voice was too
weak. Then Dick came back, and you gave
him the medicine, and he brought it to me.
I was glad to take it from Dick’s hands. I
didn’t mind what I did for him, for he was
always my very greatest friend. It’s nice for
a boy like me to have a man friend, and then,
of course, he’s my own cousin. If I had died
that time, he’d have been Sir Richard Pelham.
I thought I was going to die after I took that
medicine. I sank down faster and faster, and
I looked up as I sank and I saw Dick far above
me, and then I remembered no more.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“You were very ill, child,” said the nurse.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you think I was going to die?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought you were bad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But did you think I was going to die? I
remember so well the look on Dick’s face—all
white as if he were terrified—that was the very
last thing I saw before I went right down into
the earth. I didn’t see you at all—only Dick.
Did you suppose that I was dying?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Piers. I thought you would get better
presently.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think Dick was frightened?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps. But we will not talk of that any
more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nurse, will you take me back home to-day?
I want to see mother, and Barbara, and
Dick.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not to-day, Piers. You are very much
better since you have come to me, and it is
part of your cure to live with me for a little.
If I wear my pretty blue velvet dress and tell
you fairy tales and give you nice things to eat,
you won’t mind staying with me for a time,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; for I quite love you. You are so
changed. But when may I see Dick and
Barbara again?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will tell you that by and by. If you are
patient, you will see them all the sooner.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy lay back on his pillow with a
sigh.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“May I get up?” he asked after a moment.
“I feel quite well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will dress you myself, dear, and you shall
come and sit with me in my sitting-room.
But first I must go out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where to?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To the post-office to send a telegram.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To Dick?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, dear; not to Dick, but somebody
else.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who?” asked the child.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To my mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you a mother? You look very old
to have a mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have a mother, my dear, but she lives far
away from here, in Cornwall.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cornwall—that’s in the very, very south of
England, not far from Devonshire, where one
of my places is. You know, nurse, I am an
awfully rich boy, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, little Piers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why don’t you call me Sir Piers? It
doesn’t seem respectful to call me little Piers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I’d rather call you little Piers. I want
you to forget the other name.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Forget that I am Sir Piers Pelham! What
do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is part of your cure. I hope to have
you quite well before long, and when you are
quite well and quite strong you shall be Sir
Piers Pelham again, and you shall go back to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Dick and Barbara and to your mother and
Dr. Tarbot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dr. Tarbot,” said the boy, his face flushing.
“I hate him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is unkind. He is your good doctor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s not good, and I hate him. Well, go
and send off your telegram to your mother if
you must, only it does seem queer that you
should have one. What do you want to say
to her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want her to come here on a visit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I shall like that. It will be fun to see
you greeting your mother. Will you kiss her
much and will you obey her? Of course, you
ought to obey your mother—it’s the fifth commandment.
Well, go, nurse, now, and be
quick back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A few moments afterwards Nurse Ives went
to the nearest telegraph office and sent off a
message. The result of her message was that
early on the following morning a little woman,
with a wrinkled face and hands slightly distorted
with rheumatism, arrived on the scene.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, now, Clara, what does this mean?”
said the woman, “sending for me in such a
precious hurry. What’s up, my girl? You
look excited.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I sent for you, mother, because I want you
to take care of a little boy for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A little boy! Good gracious! Not a
patient?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“Yes, mother, a patient. I want you to
look after him—that’s why I sent for you. I’ll
tell you all particulars when you’ve had some
breakfast.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>A CRAFTY OLD LADY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Ives was like and yet unlike her
daughter. She had the same sandy complexion,
her face was slightly freckled and her
lips very thin; she had shrewd, kindly eyes,
however, and a brisk, active manner. She
was about sixty years of age. Clara bustled
about now to make her mother comfortable.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You sit just here,” she said, pushing the
old lady into the only arm-chair which the little
room contained. “After you have had a good
breakfast you shall lie down for a bit. There’s
a great deal to be done, and I have much to
tell you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, tell it and be quick, Clara. You
always were a queer one, and you look changed—you’ve
got so smart. Why are you wearing
that pretty dress? I thought you always wore
your nurse’s livery.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not going to be a nurse any more,
mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A mercy me!” said the old lady, throwing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>up her hands. “And after all the expense of
having you eddicated, and you one of the
Nightingale nurses at St. Thomas’s Hospital
and all. They think a sight of you in the old
place. Wherever I go the folks is always asking
me how Sister Clara is getting on, and I tell
you I’m just as proud as Punch of you. I say
you nurse all the dukes in London, and that
you’re took up wonderful by the Royal Family.
They believes it—some folks will believe anything.
And now you’re going to give it all
up. You’re not going into domestic service
again, are you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“After a fashion, I am, mother; but there,
don’t talk so much. Drink your warm coffee.
I’ll have a nice rasher of bacon and an egg
done for you in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t abear them cooking eggs,” said the
old lady. “I’ll have a bit of bacon if you do it
crisp and tasty. I traveled up without any
fret or worry, and slept the whole of the way.
What a queer, extravagant thing you was to
say I might come first class. Not me! I
traveled third. I’d like to see myself first.
It wouldn’t seem respectful to the quality.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara did not reply. She knew her mother’s
ways.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s no necessity to be so very close
about money now,” she said, after a long
pause. “I’m doing well and I want you to
have all comforts.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“You’re doing well when you give up your
profession? It looks like it. Are you gwine
to be married?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, that’s about it, mother. You’ve hit
the nail on the head now. I am.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me all about it, Clara,” said the old
lady. “I love to hear a right good rattling
love story. Is it to the grocer, or the fishmonger,
or the baker? I always said you’d
do well in a shop. You’re the sort to draw
customers, though you are plain, to be sure.
Your freckles seem to have spread. Can’t you
get a lotion to take ’em off? They’re not at
all becoming.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me, mother, don’t mind about my
freckles now. I was born with them, and they
must stay on my face!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That they must, Clara, and it’s wrong for
me to grumble, but I did fret about them
freckles when you was a little tot. Dear heart!
I used to dream of ’em at nights. I used to
say, they’ll come between her and matrimony—such
a plague of ’em as you had—but now it
seems I was all wrong. Maybe freckles have
come into fashion. Who’s the lucky man,
Clara?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s not the baker, nor the grocer, nor
the fishmonger,” said Clara quietly. “Here,
mother, eat your bacon. I’ll tell you everything
afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c010'>While Mrs. Ives enjoyed her breakfast, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>nurse withdrew into the inner room and began
to dress little Piers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m ever so well,” said the boy. “I’m
going out for a bit to-day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, my dear, it’s raining.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That doesn’t matter. You can send for
my carriage. I always drive in the brougham
on wet days. Nurse, who was that person
you were talking to? I heard a voice keep
chattering and chattering. Whose was
it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother’s, dear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has your mother come? Oh, I am glad.
I want to see her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You shall see her when you are dressed,
Piers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I’m very sorry I wasn’t in the room
when she arrived. I wanted to see you kiss
her. Are you beginning to obey her already?
You know it’s the fifth commandment—children
ought to obey their parents.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, it’s all right, dear. Don’t talk quite so
much, Piers. Sit still while I dress you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I feel so well and jolly,” said the child.
“When may I go home?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not for a bit yet. You would be as bad
as ever if you did—you’d have that sinking feeling
you spoke to me about.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The child shuddered and began to tremble
visibly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re not going back at present, darling.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>You don’t mind staying in this cosy little house
with me, do you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s like a doll’s house,” said the child;
“and your mother must be the head doll.
What fun! I’m one of the little ones and
you’re another doll.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, come here, Piers, and stand by me,
and let me say something. I believe you are
a brave boy and that you wouldn’t tell a lie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course I wouldn’t. I’m quite an important
person, you know. Do you think great
men such as I shall be tell lies?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t believe you could tell a lie, Piers.
Now, I want you to promise me something;
I am sure when you promise you will keep your
word. I don’t want my mother to know that
you are Sir Piers Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot tell you why. Sometime she may
know, but not yet. All you have to say is that
you are Piers, little Piers, my patient. You
are not to tell her what your surname is, nor
anything about the grand house you used to
live in, nor about your mother, nor Dick, nor
Barbara. Just say you are my little patient and
that you love me—don’t say anything else.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Must I really promise?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems such an awful lot to promise, and
I am afraid. You know, I am not old and I
might forget. It’s difficult to remember that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>you’re not to talk of the people you love. Why
must I do it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Piers, I thought it would be fun, but
you need not if you dislike it. I cannot take
you to my mother if you do not, that’s all. I’ll
have to send her back to Cornwall. She’s a
very amusing old lady, and you’d like her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I’ll promise then,” said the child.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kiss me, Piers, on each cheek, and then
make me the promise very solemnly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If it’s going to be solemn I’d better kneel
down and pray to God to help me to keep it,”
said the boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can do that by and by when you say
your prayers, but not now. Kiss me and
promise.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I promise,” said the child.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s my brave little lad. Now I will take
you and show you to my mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As Clara spoke she opened the door which
divided the bedroom from the little sitting-room
and brought Sir Piers into the sitting-room.
The child came forward with his usual
manly grace. He flung back his handsome
little head and stared into the eyes of the old
lady.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My word! what a fine little fellow!” she
cried. “Come and kiss me, my little lad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy held up his coral lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I like you,” he said softly. “Are you
nurse’s mother?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The old lady made room for Piers on her
lap.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a very wrinkled face you have,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No more wrinkles than I ought to have,”
was the reply. “It’s becoming to have
wrinkles when you’re turning a bit aged. It’s
like the russet apple when it’s ripe—I’m ripe,
and that’s why the wrinkles is there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ripe,” said little Piers. He touched the
old cheek with his tiny finger. “I like you,”
he repeated after a pause. “I’m glad I made
that promise.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What promise, little un?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, something to Nurse Clara, but I mustn’t
tell you. If I told you it would be breaking
my word. Nurse, come here. I’m going to
be a good boy, and I’m going to love your mother.
If I love her and if I keep my word for a whole
week, may I go home?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps,” said Nurse Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives fixed her shrewd eyes on her
daughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s something at the back of all this,”
thought the old lady to herself. “That boy is
no ordinary patient. I’ll get to the bottom of
it, or my name’s not Sarah Ives. It’s just like
Clara, she was always one for mysteries.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a fine day,” said Mrs. Ives, getting up
as she spoke and going to the window.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“No, it isn’t; it rains,” said little Piers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It did rain, but it’s fine now. Suppose I
take you for a walk?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes,” said the child, clapping his
hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you mustn’t walk to-day,” said Nurse
Clara. “It’s part of the cure; the doctor wishes
him to stay indoors,” she continued, turning
to her mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>Little Piers frowned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m ever so much better, and the air would
do me good,” he said. “You might send for
the——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nurse Ives held up a warning finger.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are not to go out,” she said. “Mother,
you are much too tired after your long journey
to think of such a thing. I am going to leave
you both now for a time, as I have got several
things to buy. You look well after the child
while I’m out, mother; you’ll be careful of
him, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Careful!” said Mrs. Ives, “when I’ve had
six of my own, and buried five of ’em. You’re
the only one left, Clara, and your freckles was
always a worry. I not understand how to look
after a child! I don’t know what you mean.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course, mother, you’re splendid with
children. Well, I’ll be back in an hour or
so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nurse Ives put on a smart hat—the hat was
made of black lace—she covered her sandy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>locks and freckled face with a spotted veil, and,
nodding to her mother and the child, went
out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She do look smart—quite the lady,” said the
old woman, glancing at Piers as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>Piers nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She’s very handsome, and I love her,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, now, child, it surprises me to hear
you talk. I never would have said Clara was
handsome, though she is my own darter, but
there’s no accounting for tastes. How close
this room is! Now I’d like to go for a walk
uncommon. Suppose you and me was to go
out unbeknown to Clara?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Might we?” said little Piers, his face
coloring.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Might you? And what’s to hinder you if
I say you may? We might go for a little stroll
all by our two selves, mightn’t we?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d love it better than anything,” said little
Piers. “But perhaps Nurse Clara——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nurse Clara needn’t know, you little silly.
Go and fetch your cap and we’ll be off.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Little Piers looked puzzled for a moment;
then his face lit up and he ran eagerly into
the bedroom. He soon came back.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t find my cap,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives accompanied him into Clara’s
bedroom. They searched high and low in vain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a pity!” she said. “And I thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>I’d like a spell of the air. Well, you look here,
little boy, we will go out presently when
Clara comes in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I could show you the house where I
used to live; but oh, I forgot, I can’t—it would
be telling my secret.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you have a secret, little un?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Haven’t I just—such a big one!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder now, if I could guess it,” said
Mrs. Ives in a thoughtful voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Piers clapped his hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What fun if you did,” he cried. “Nurse
wouldn’t mind if you guessed it—that wouldn’t
be <em>me</em> telling.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course it wouldn’t. Well, now, let me
see; you are high born?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Piers nodded. “Good, good,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And rich?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good again,” said Piers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I was to see that house where you lived
I could tell a lot more. Showing me the house
isn’t letting out the secret.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Isn’t it? Perhaps not. I’d like to show
you the house very much indeed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But perhaps you have forgotten what part
of London it’s in?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not I—not I: it’s near Harley Street
where that dreadful doctor lives—I hate that
doctor, Mrs. Ives. Oh, I know quite well how
to get there, and as you say, it wouldn’t be
telling.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“Of course it wouldn’t; and it would be
much nicer for you if I guessed your secret,
for then we could talk it over together. I tell
you what: let’s go out at once, without waiting
for that cap of yours. We can buy a new one
for sixpence at the first shop we come across.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They went.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE DIE CAST.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Everything turned out according to Nurse
Ives’ wishes. In a week’s time she and Dr.
Tarbot were married by special license at St.
James’s, Fore Street.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot made a sullen bridegroom. Even
during the ceremony he showed a morose face.
Clara, on the contrary, looked animated, eager,
excitedly happy.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ceremony was over, the signatures signed
in the vestry, and the bride and bridegroom
were congratulated by their witnesses. Tarbot
put a couple of guineas into each of the verger’s
palms. He also paid a handsome fee to the
clergyman, and the bride and the bridegroom
were off. Tarbot had asked Clara where she
wished to spend her honeymoon, and she
promptly answered Paris.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know Paris well, of course, but I could
never see enough of it,” she said. “I’d love
to go there again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot was quite agreeable. Her choice
even pleased him.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>They put up at a fashionable hotel, and Clara
spent a busy time. She did not waste it in
sight-seeing. When she was in Paris before
she had never visited the Louvre, or Fontainebleau,
or Versailles, nor did she go to them
now. She preferred the shops; she went to
them often and with good effect. Her intention
was, if possible, to reconstruct herself.
She had saved some money of her own, and she
now spent it freely. It was necessary for her,
as Tarbot’s wife, to make a good appearance.
So she went from shop to shop choosing
clothes, and choosing well. Her husband
never accompanied her, and she was all the
better pleased at this. She had a greater opportunity
of doing what she meant to do.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hour by hour and day by day the woman
was changing. She shed her vulgarity as if it
were a skin which was useless. She went to
the best hairdresser to have her hair arranged.
She was told that she had lovely hair—quite
the fashionable tone. She got the most expensive
lotions to bring out its brilliancy.
She bought additional hair at a fabulous price,
to pile on her head to add to the richness of
her locks, which, in color perfect, were in
quantity a little scanty. She also purchased
cosmetics, which she applied night and morning
to her freckled face. The cosmetics did
nothing for the freckles, but she fancied they
did. She bought the finest black lace, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>many garments trimmed with jet, and soft
sweeping robes, mostly black. And Tarbot
found out by degrees that he was not ashamed
to walk with Clara, and that people turned to
look at her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the matter with you?” he said
one day.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you ask? Don’t you like my
dress?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I like it too well—I should not know you
in it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara smiled. Tarbot went on gazing at her
critically.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have a good figure,” he said; “a very
good figure. I had no idea of it when I married
you. I did not know you were so tall, or
that you had such a small waist. Your hips
are well developed, too, and your shoulders
are good—you are a finely proportioned
woman. If you were not so thin you might
even be handsome.”</p>

<p class='c010'>While he paid her these compliments she
longed passionately for him to give her one
affectionate glance; but this he had never considered
in the bargain, and certainly did not
intend to bestow.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Clara had purchased her wardrobe,
finally buying an evening dress from Worth,
who studied her good figure and peculiar face,
and made her a robe which was afterwards
talked about in more than one London drawing-room,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>she told her husband that it was
time to return home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the fortnight is not up yet,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind. You are anxious to get back
to your patients. I don’t care a fig for fine
scenery or picture galleries, or old palaces, or
anything of that sort. I came to Paris to
get my trousseau. I have got it, and now I
wish to return to England.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, Clara,” said Tarbot. “I am
abundantly willing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The pair crossed to Dover by the night boat
that evening, and early on the following morning
arrived at Tarbot’s house in Harley Street.
The servants expected them, and were up.
The weather was getting chilly, and Clara was
glad to see fires in the rooms and the whole
place looking fresh and clean. She looked
round with approbation, gave her orders to the
footman in a haughty tone, which made him
secretly incline to the belief that his master
had married a duchess in disguise, and then
swept up-stairs to her own room.</p>

<p class='c010'>This room, by Tarbot’s orders, had been
newly furnished. It was bare, cold, and correct,
but Clara was pleased with it. She liked
the sense of space which it gave, and she
thought that the pale blue and white furniture
would suit her complexion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the way,” she said, turning to Tarbot,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>who followed her, “you intend to give me
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</span></i> to do what I like in the re-arranging
of the house?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly,” he replied. “I shall have no
time to attend to the house. A great number
of fresh patients have written for appointments.
As soon as I have had breakfast I shall order
the brougham and go round at once to attend
to them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well,” said Clara. “That will suit
me perfectly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you not tired?” he said. “You have
been up all night. Wouldn’t you like to lie
down for a little?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tired!” she answered. “I! You forget
what my old life was.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“True; but you are so changed—so transformed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Luke!” said Clara. She was standing
before a glass, removing her hat; she was unpinning
it carefully. Those red locks, frizzled
and curled, required careful manipulation.
She smoothed her hair with her hands, and
then, turning, faced her husband. He was
leaving the room, but looked round at the sound
of her voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you love me even a little?” she asked
suddenly.</p>

<p class='c010'>He uttered a vexed exclamation and stared
at her.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“What an inconvenient question, and at such
a time!” he exclaimed. “I want to go out. I
cannot talk of love now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She ran up to him, slipped behind him, shut
the door, and then stood facing him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Answer me,” she said. Her heart was
beating hard. “Everything in all the world
depends upon your answer. Can you by any
chance get to feel not <em>sorry</em> that you married
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not sorry?” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; can you ever get to feel glad?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Glad!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, yes! Speak, speak!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Glad that I married you!” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Speak, Luke! Tell me the truth.” She
clasped her hands tightly together. There
was an imploring expression in her eyes, her
lips were trembling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Glad that I tied myself to you!” he continued.
“Good Heavens! what are you made
of? Let me go.” He pushed her roughly
aside, opened the door, slammed it after him,
and ran down-stairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara listened with a wild expression on her
face until his retreating footsteps ceased to
sound. Then she fell on her knees, clasped
her hands before her face, and burst into a
passion of weeping.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The die is cast,” she said at last when she
rose to her feet. “I am his wife, and I love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>him, but I will oppose him through thick and
thin now—he has himself to blame.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A few minutes afterwards, quite calm and
cold and placid-looking, the new mistress of
No. 250, Harley Street, swept down-stairs. She
had already changed her traveling dress for
one of black velvet. This dress had a long
train. Round her neck she wore a scarf artistically
arranged. The scarf was of rich old
Spanish lace. Her face, very pale, rose above
its picturesque surroundings, looking haughty
and well. The footman was decidedly impressed
by her. The butler, however, knew
better.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She ain’t a lady—don’t tell me!” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, she is,” cried the footman. “Didn’t
you notice her ’aughty hairs? Yes, she’s a
lady, and no mistake. Most probable she
come to grief with her first, and took up Tarbot
as better than nothing. She’s a marchioness
at the least.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Marchioness you!” said the butler.
“Don’t talk folly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot was waiting impatiently for his breakfast.
Clara swept to the head of her table, sat
down with what the footman was pleased to
call a marchioness air, and poured out the
coffee. The servants left the room, and the
husband and wife were alone together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall want a maid,” said Clara, raising
her eyes to Tarbot’s face.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“A maid!” he exclaimed. “You! What
in the name of fortune for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I, as much as another,” she answered. “Do
you suppose I can attend to my own clothes
and the thousand and one things which a maid
ought to do for a fine lady? Whatever I was
in the past, I am now your wife and a fine
lady, and as such I must have a maid. I
shall go to Mrs. Mount to-day and secure
one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As you please,” replied Tarbot. “Now I
have eaten enough, and must be off. Don’t
expect me to lunch. After I have seen my
patients I shall drive round to the hospital.
To-morrow, of course, I shall be in to receive
patients from ten to one as usual, but to-day I
am simply going to announce my return to
town.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the way,” said Clara as he rose from
the table, “what about Miss Evershed?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot gave an involuntary start. Clara
noticed a sort of quiver which seemed to run
through his frame. He was standing with his
back to her; now he turned slowly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Evershed, why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When is she to be married?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know. I have heard nothing either
of her or Pelham for the last fortnight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will find out something to-day?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Probably, as I intend to call to see Mrs.
Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“Is Mrs. Pelham still in London?” asked
Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, the house is her own.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s a good thing for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you say so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because I know it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a good thing for me,” said Tarbot
slowly, “a very good thing. I thought of that
when I arranged other matters. Good-by,
Clara; expect me when you see me.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='large'>BLACK MISCHIEF.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When her husband left the house Clara sent
for the cook. She gave explicit orders, and
the cook was respectful. The woman had
lived before now in what she considered high
families—families where thirty servants at least
were kept. She endeavored to impress Clara,
but Clara was not impressed in the very least.
The new mistress told the woman exactly what
she required, all her remarks were pertinent
and to the point, and the cook could not help
respecting her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara gave firm orders, short and decisive.
The best tradespeople were to be dealt with,
the cooking was to be of the highest quality—dainty,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">recherché</span></i>, agreeable to the palate.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cook went down-stairs highly pleased,
and then Clara proceeded to interview the rest
of the servants. She acted her part to perfection—they
were all pleased, inclined to be
deferential. Even the butler was satisfied,
and was disposed to think there was something
in the footman’s words.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“Not that she’s a marchioness,” he said,
when he was alone with that functionary;
“but I don’t say she mightn’t have married a
baronight when in a previous state.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This admission was honey to the footman,
who had been severely snubbed early in the
morning, and everything was likely to go
smoothly in Tarbot’s household.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having arranged matters so far, Clara now
went out. She told the footman to whistle for
a hansom, and when it arrived she stepped
into it with his aid.</p>

<p class='c010'>She desired the cabby to drive her to a job-master’s.
She saw the head of the establishment
and asked him to send round for orders
every morning and afternoon until she had
purchased a carriage of her own. She looked
at the different victorias and landaus which
were for hire, selected two of the best, which
she said she was willing to pay special terms
for the use of, and then told the man to take
the victoria round to 250 Harley Street, within
an hour. She then returned home.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the appointed time the victoria drew up
at the door. Again the footman helped Mrs.
Tarbot into her carriage, and threw a light fur
rug over her knees. She desired the man to
drive into Oxford Street, but after they had
turned the corner she spoke to him again and
told him that her real destination was Goodge
Street.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Having arrived at her old quarters, she
ordered the man to drive about for an hour
and afterwards come back for her. She then
ran up-stairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was dressed from head to foot in black,
for she had discovered that no other color
suited her so well, no other style of dress
brought out the best points in her figure or
made the most of that dead-white complexion
and that brilliant red-gold hair. She knocked
at the door behind which she had so often sat
and waited and longed for Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now she was his wife, his lawful wedded
wife. She had taken possession of his house,
of his riches—his position in society was hers,
his name was hers. She possessed all of him
except the part she most longed to secure—the
man’s heart. Could she ever have that? She
felt that it was beyond her purchase. She
hated and she loved him for what he withheld:
she hated him to the point of extreme pain,
she loved him to the point of madness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives was in, and so was little Piers.
Mrs. Ives started back when she saw Clara
and began to say that her daughter was
out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nonsense, mother; don’t talk folly,” said
Clara. “Don’t you know me?” She flung
back her veil.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A mercy me! Whoever would suppose
that it was you, Clara,” said the old woman.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“Why, you <em>are</em> fine. Fine feathers make fine
birds. Piers, here’s your nurse come back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m not Piers’s nurse any more. How are
you, Piers, all the same?” said Clara. She
now entered the room, shut the door behind
her and turned to face her mother and the boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>After one admiring glance, Piers ran and
clasped his arms round her neck.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I always said you were a very handsome
woman,” he cried. “You look awfully fine
now you wear black. Black is the proper
color for a lady to wear, and you’re a lady now,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope so, Piers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A mercy me!” said the old woman again.
She still stood in the background. From time
to time she dropped a sort of involuntary
curtsey.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you sure it’s you, Clara?” she said at
last, coming to the light.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stare at me as long as you like, mother.
When you have quite done, I’ll sit down. I
have a good deal to say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“May I sit on your knee?” asked the boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may,” said Clara. She placed herself
in the rocking-chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy scrambled on to her knee.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m quite well again,” he said in a low,
excited voice, “and I’ve kept my promise,
but it was awfully hard. Do you know how I
managed?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Clara nodded but did not speak. She was
looking at the child with a hungry expression
in her eyes. There was a wonderful drawing
in her heart towards him. She felt that here
was something more valuable than her grand
house, her fine dress, her large establishment.
She looked into the boy’s velvety eyes, then
suddenly clasped him to her heart and pressed
her lips to his.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But for me, little Piers, but for me,” she
said with a sort of strangled sob.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you talk in such a queer way?”
he asked. “Are you frightened about anything?
Are you worried?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, I am only glad, Piers. Don’t ask
me any more. So you kept——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes, I kept the secret,” he said, nodding
to her, an expression of delight visiting
his small mouth. “And I’m just going to
tell how I managed. It was such fun. I told
your mother—she’s a dear old thing, but she’s
not handsome like you, nor is she a lady—I
told her each morning at breakfast that I had
a <em>great</em> secret, and then I got her to guess
what it was.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good Heavens!” said Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was such fun,” continued Piers. “She
used to guess all sorts of things, and sometimes
she shot very near the mark, nurse, but
never quite. Sometimes she was almost cross,
and she would say I must tell her. She’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>wonderfully full of curiosity for such an old
body. She never <em>quite</em> guessed, though once
or twice she got very near to it. One day she
said perhaps I was a prince in disguise. Oh,
how I clapped my hands when she said that!
I laughed—didn’t I laugh just! I said, ‘Good,
good, good, but not <em>quite</em> right.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For Heaven’s sake, child, hush!” said
Clara. “Mother, do you mind going into the
other room for a moment?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Highty tighty!” said the old lady. “I
can see well there’s a change come over you,
Clara. You wouldn’t talk to your mother like
that in the old days. Oh, to be sure I’ll go;
but I intend to have a word with you myself
by and by.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The old woman went into the bedroom and
slammed the door behind her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, Piers,” said Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you going to be angry with me?”
asked Piers. “You look something like you
used to look when you made me stare into
your eyes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you remember that?” asked Mrs. Tarbot
in some alarm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do, in a puzzled sort of way. I used
rather to like it at first. I used to feel that I
loved you, and yet I hated you. I felt I’d do
anything in all the world for you, and yet I
could not bear you. Nurse, you’re not going
to make me look at you again like that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“Never, as there is a heaven above,” answered
the woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why are you trembling? Let me keep
my arms tight round your neck. That soft
black lace suits you awfully well. Mother
wears lace like that—it’s very good, and it’s
expensive. Are you a rich lady now, nurse?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I’m rather glad. Perhaps you’ll be
able soon to take a better room. Are you
coming back to live with us, nurse, with your
mother and me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Piers; but now I’m not going to talk
of my own affairs. There is another thing
I must say. You are not to set my mother
guessing your secret.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why, why?” asked the child in astonishment.
“It amuses me and it keeps me from
telling it. I’m very dull, you know, very dull
indeed. I, who have so much, am now given
so little. If it were not that Mrs. Ives takes
me out two or three times daily, and if it were
not that I always go——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?” said Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, now you are looking really cross. I
always walk past Ashley Mansions. I take
Mrs. Ives there every day. I stop in front of
No. 12, and when I’m there, just at the opposite
side of the street, I make her guess harder
than ever.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This must be put a stop to,” said Clara
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>under her breath. “I have not come back a
moment too soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the matter with you, nurse? How
queer you look!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s nothing the matter, dear. Oh, yes,
what you did was quite natural, and I—I am
not cross. You are going to have a change
soon, dear, darling little Piers, a splendid
change. Now run into the bedroom and send
my mother in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is fun,” said the boy. “You have
secrets with me and secrets with your mother.”
He strutted into the bedroom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s your turn now,” he said to the old
lady. “I am to be shut in here while you
two talk secrets. I hate secrets, but they’re
awful ’citing. Go, Mrs. Ives, and talk to her.
She’s a very handsome woman, and she’s a
lady, but I do wish she didn’t want us to keep
so many secrets.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s up?” asked Mrs. Ives. “Whisper
to me, honey.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think it’s because we walked past Ashley
Mansions.” He stopped and clapped his hand
to his mouth. “Don’t you remember how I
stopped opposite No. 12 and made you guess—don’t
you remember?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course I remember,” said Mrs. Ives,
with a toss of her head. “And I can put two
and two together as well as most. I’ll have a
talk with Clara. Clara may keep things from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the rest of the world, but she’s not going to
keep them from her old mother. You rest
quiet, my little lamb; you and I will be a
match for Clara yet, although she is such a
fine lady.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives went back into the sitting-room.
She dropped a mocking curtsey to her daughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A mercy me!” she cried for the third
time. “And what’s your ladyship’s pleasure
with me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t talk nonsense, mother,” said Clara.
“Sit down and let us discuss things.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m agreeable,” said old Mrs. Ives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This kind of thing can’t go on, you know,”
said Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What kind of thing, your ladyship?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, mother, don’t be so irritating; I hate
you to speak in that strain. Look here, you
mustn’t pry into my secrets about the boy. If
I choose to keep him here that’s my affair.
You’re fond of a bit of money, aren’t you, and
I can make it well worth your while to keep
quiet and lie low, but the moment you guess
what I want to keep hidden, the money
stops. The child goes elsewhere, you understand?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To be sure, Clara,” said Mrs. Ives—the
sparkle became very bright in her eyes as she
spoke, and she screwed up her shrewd little
mouth until it resembled a round O.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“I’ll be careful,” she cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, then, that’s all right. And now
please tell me exactly what you have guessed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What I have guessed,” said the old woman
coloring. “He ain’t your own child, I know
that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course not, mother: don’t run away
with such a wild idea. But that’s not the
thought in your mind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it ain’t; but why should I tell it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must tell it—I insist.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ve got that masterful, you ain’t what
you were. I don’t think riches have improved
you, but if you want to know really what I do
think, there’s somebody as wants to get rid of
that child, and you are given money to hide
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re wrong there,” said Clara. “I have
not got a farthing for the boy. I’m keeping
him away from danger, that’s what I’m doing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Away from danger? Is it likely any
one would hurt a pretty lamb like that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are always wolves in the world ready
to eat up pretty lambs,” said Clara. “But
now listen, mother; this air does not suit
Piers, and I’m going to send him away. He
shall go down to Cornwall with you. You’ll
keep him in your own cottage, and say he’s a
boy you’ve been given to nurse. He will
spend the winter with you, and I’ll give you
two pounds a week as long as you look after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>him, and don’t guess any more than you know
at present.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Two pounds a week!—A mercy me! how
will you get the money, Clara?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“From my husband.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To be sure. I forgot you was married.
You never told me the name of your husband.
Your name is no longer Ives.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not likely.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is your name?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara hesitated, then she said slowly,
“Tarbot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tarbot, Tarbot—it sounds like Turbot—you
ain’t surely married to that doctor fellow?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must not talk of him in that strain.
He’s one of the best doctors in London—one
of the cleverest, I mean. Yes, I am his wife.
I have a fine house and plenty of money, but
I don’t want you to come to my house, and I
don’t want the boy to come there. If either
of you come to the house, or if ever you let
out that I gave you the boy to take care of,
mischief will come of it; black mischief
mother, black mischief.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said the old woman. Her voice
was cowed and she felt frightened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come over here to me, mother. I’ll whisper
something to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You give me the creeps,” began Mrs.
Ives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come here, mother, come here.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>The old woman was afraid to stir. Clara
rose and went to her, she knelt by her side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are those who want to get rid of the
child,” she said in a hoarse whisper, “but
with you, mother, he is safe. Now you understand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I think I do,” said the old woman.
She sat back in her chair. She was white and
trembling.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <span class='large'>DICK’S SECRET.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pelham mourned for her boy in the
deepest black. She gradually recovered her
health, but her spirits were low, and she indulged
in much weeping. She began to look
pale and old, and her friends all pitied her
sincerely.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the first fortnight after the unexpected
death of the boy Mrs. Evershed did not dare
to visit the unhappy widow. She felt that
under such peculiar, such wonderful circumstances,
she could scarcely command her own
face. The event which was a terrible blow to
Mrs. Pelham was life and the resurrection of all
things bright and beautiful to Mrs. Evershed.
Now, indeed, Dick Pelham was a son-in-law
after her own heart. She did not dare to
hurry on the wedding too soon, but at the
same time she was glad to tell her friends that
Barbara was engaged to the dear fellow quite
a fortnight before his little cousin died.</p>

<p class='c010'>People were fond of congratulating Barbara
and talking about her luck, but Barbara herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>quickly put a stop to this. She felt the
child’s death acutely, and was low-spirited and
nervous. She was happy because she was
engaged to the man of her heart, but in other
ways she was not happy. Riches had come
to her; her mother’s affairs were all put absolutely
straight. In future she would never
know the meaning of want of money. Money
in full abundance was to be hers, but somehow—she
could not quite tell why—a certain zest
was taken out of her life.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to Dick, there was a queer change in him.
He gave up visiting at Mrs. Pelham’s house,
and he hated to hear his cousin’s name mentioned.
When alone with Barbara he was apt
to lapse into long fits of silence. Once he told
Barbara that he would fifty times rather work
as a navvy than step into the riches which now
were his. Barbara felt surprised at words
which she considered too strong for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If it was God’s will——” she began.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it was not His will,” interrupted Dick
fiercely. “Don’t talk about it any more,
Barbara.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He became gloomy, reserved, and irritable;
over and over these moods visited him. In the
old days there was not a gayer, happier fellow
than Dick Pelham. He had a kind word for
every one; now he was morose and disagreeable.
Barbara could not account for the change
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>in his manner. Mrs. Pelham noticed it. She
spoke to Barbara about it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is a different man. I should not know
him for the same,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is grief, it is grief,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh darling! it is sweet of him to grieve,
and I love him for it,” said the poor woman,
“but I wish he would grieve in the way you do,
Barbara. If he would only come and talk to
me, we might look at my angel’s toys together
and comfort ourselves with memories of him;
but to keep away from me, never to come near
the house, it looks strange—it is strange.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To this remark Barbara made no reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>One day, about six weeks after little Piers’s
death, Pelham called at Mrs. Evershed’s
house. He had written Barbara a note to say
that he wished to see her on an important matter,
and begged her to be at home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How ill you look!” cried Barbara when
she saw him. “Your face is dreadfully white.
I wish you would tell me what is wrong.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have come here to do so,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! I am glad of that. I am so puzzled
about you, and so is Mrs. Pelham. Mother
noticed even yesterday that you were not quite
so——Oh, it does not matter what she said;
we won’t talk of it. But ever since dear little
Piers died I cannot help seeing that you are
changed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am worried, Barbara. I am more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>worried—I am tortured by a doubt. That
doubt makes all the world dark.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it, Dick?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may not wish to marry me when you
know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dick!” The girl’s face turned white.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you heard that Tarbot is married?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dr. Tarbot married!” cried Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How startled you look! Does it affect you
much?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It astonishes me, Dick. But why should
you look at me so strangely?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know myself,” said the young man.
“I feel suspicious and queer about everything.
He loved you, Barbara.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He said so, but men quickly change,” said
the girl. Then she added with spirit, “I never
could bear him. I was grateful to him for
what he did for mother, but I never could bear
him for himself. It is a relief that he is married.
Who is the girl?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will never guess her name.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then tell me, if I am not likely to guess.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Barbara, he must have done this for a
reason. He has married that red-haired
nurse who attended little Piers when he was
ill.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara’s utter astonishment was reflected in
her face. A queer thrill of alarm ran through
her frame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sit still,” said Pelham. “I must ask you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>to share my burden with me. That marriage
confirms a suspicion which I hold.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What, Dick—what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham began to pace up and down the
room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am pursued by a horrible fear,” he said
suddenly. “I think—nay, sometimes my
thoughts seem certainties—I think that little
Piers came by his death through foul means.
Barbara, the thought terrifies me; it takes the
joy out of everything. I am haunted by it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dick! Dick!” said the girl. “Why, this
is madness,” she continued. “I have heard
of people getting queer when they are overwrought
as you have been lately. Your nerves
are out of order. Darling, do cast the awful
thought from you. There is no foundation
for it—none. It terrifies me even to hear you
speak.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye,” said Pelham; “but what if you had
to live with my thought day and night, if it
haunted you in your dreams, if it pursued you
wherever you went—just that little life clamoring
to be avenged? Barbara, you don’t suppose
that this is merely a figment of the imagination—that
I have no cause for what I think?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Dick! I am sick with terror. Must you
tell me any more?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must. Afterwards we need not talk of it.
Oh, I cannot marry you keeping all this dark.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is a figment of the imagination,” cried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the girl. “Did we not go into the room a
moment or two after his death? Dick, I will
not listen. You are nervous. Marry me, Dick—dear
Dick. Let our wedding be soon. I will
comfort you, I will cheer you, I will banish
those awful thoughts.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you really wish to hear nothing more?”
asked Pelham, gazing at her in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“For the present I do. I am so certain that
you have no ground for your terrors. Dr.
Tarbot is bad, but he is not a murderer. Dick,
when I am your wife, I can exorcise the demon.
I don’t mind what the world says. Let
us be married quietly, and at once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have not got your trousseau. Most
girls think of that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We can get what we want after we are
married.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham stood up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You really wish me to say nothing more
about my suspicions?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t listen—there’s nothing in them.
We will marry and I will make you happy—so
happy, Dick, that you will forget your nervous
terrors.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You tempt me, Barbara.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say yes, then, my darling. Surely you
won’t refuse?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not I. I long for you. I do believe you
are the only one who can put me right, and your
feeling that there is nothing in it gives me a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>momentary sensation of comfort, but remember
I have not told you <em>why</em> I suspect.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You shall some day—when we are married,
but not now. You are prejudiced; you hate
Dr. Tarbot—surely not more than I hate him—but
that he should stoop to such a horrible
crime—no, Dick, no. Turn your thought away
from it. It is wrong.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When shall we be married?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whenever you like—next week, the week
after, whenever you please.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The sooner the better,” answered Pelham.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE WRONG MEDICINE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The wedding took place in a fortnight.
The marriage was solemnized at St. James’s,
Fore Street. This was the church which
Barbara and her mother attended on Sundays.
Seeing the church open, one or two spectators
dropped in. They got quietly into seats, and
waited while the service went on. They noticed
the firm upright figure of the bride, her
clear voice. They noticed the bridegroom also—his
tall, erect frame, his gallant bearing. But
as the bride and bridegroom left the church
together more than one person noticed the
shadow on his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What does it mean?” they said. “This
is a true love marriage; we have heard the
particulars, and the bridegroom has just come
into enormous wealth. What does it mean?
He does not look a happy man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the spectators were two whose eyes
Barbara encountered with an obvious start.
Seated in a pew which opened into the center
aisle was Dr. Tarbot. He gave both Pelham
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>and Barbara a keen, bright glance. In a distant
part of the church Tarbot’s wife also witnessed
the ceremony. On this occasion she
preferred not to sit with her husband. Tarbot
had no idea that she was in the church, but
Pelham and Barbara noticed her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara felt a queer thrill of fear as she
glanced for an instant at the light blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the church the pair went straight to
Dover, crossed to Calais, spent one night in
Paris, and then went on to Switzerland. It
was late autumn now, and Switzerland was in
all the glory of its autumn coloring. After the
first two or three days Barbara determined to
cast aside the fear which haunted her—the fear
with regard to her husband’s sanity—for she
never for a moment gave the least credence to
there being any truth in his suspicions, and
began to enjoy herself. She was with the man
she loved, her best dreams were realized—she
was Dick’s forever.</p>

<p class='c010'>In her eyes he had always been a hero, one
of the best of men. In truth, he was by nature
a man any girl might love—frank, independent,
brave, fearless. Barbara felt that she loved
him all the more because his great riches
slightly oppressed him, because his grief for
his young cousin’s untimely death had for the
time upset his nerves. She felt that her devotion,
her love must work wonders. When
she found that he did not care to talk about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the house and wealth which had come to him
so unexpectedly, Barbara also avoided the
subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had made up her mind, however. She
knew that what Pelham wanted was plenty of occupation.
Their honeymoon, therefore, should
not be too long—they would go back to England
within a month or six weeks, and take up
the onerous duties which now had fallen on
their shoulders. When he worked, when he
went in and out amongst his people, when he
took up the position of landlord on a large
scale, Pelham would drop that gloom which
enveloped him like a mantle.</p>

<p class='c010'>Four weeks passed by, and the bride began
to have anxious moments with regard to the
approaching return to England. She had
always lived a busy life, and did not care for a
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">dolce far niente</span></i> existence longer than could be
helped. The pair were spending their last
week at Glion. The hotel where they were
staying would be closed at the end of a month.
On a certain evening they stood together on
a balcony outside the big drawing-room. A
waiter brought them coffee; they sat with a
small table between them. Pelham was smoking
a fragrant cigar, and Barbara in one of
her pretty white dresses looked shadowy and
ethereal in the half-light.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dick, do you know what this reminds me
of?” she said, laying her hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“No,” he answered. He started when she
touched him, for he was given to starting of late.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It reminds me of that happy night when
you asked me if I would be your wife. I had
two proposals that night.” Barbara laughed
as she spoke. “Before you said those words
which made me the happiest girl in the world
Dr. Tarbot had spoken of his love. We were
on the balcony just outside the drawing-room
in Mark Place. The light was subdued—something
like this—Dr. Tarbot spoke with
great and strange passion. I see his face even
now, and the queer look in his eyes when I
refused him. All the time he was speaking I
could not help thinking that I hated him more
each moment. I left him on the balcony and
went into the drawing-room. Then you met
me and we strolled together to the conservatories.
Do you remember, Dick?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you remember the scent of that rose?
It was a Gloire de Dijon. You touched it with
your fingers as you spoke.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” he replied again, and now he
stretched out his hands and clasped one of
hers, holding it in a warm pressure. “I am
the luckiest fellow in the world,” he said,
“but I wish to heaven I could——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You could do what?” she answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get rid of that suspicion or—or verify it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dick dear!” said Barbara in her most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>soothing voice. She slipped nearer to him.
“I have changed my mind. We had better
have this thing out. What do you want to
verify?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham looked at her steadily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you really wish to know at last?” he
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will be a relief to tell you. You remember
that Piers always slept in the nursery.
The dressing-room was just beyond, and the
nurse kept the medicine and all bottles in the
dressing-room. The first night I visited him
I went with her to the door of the dressing-room.
She gave me the medicine, and I took
it into the room alone. I gave the child the
medicine, and just when he had finished it
the nurse came back. The boy complained
that the medicine tasted queer and sweet, not
like that which he had been taking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The nurse took the glass and tasted what
was left, and said that she thought the child
must have had the wrong medicine. She
went out of the room as she spoke and shut
the door after her. I forgot about this at the
time, but it came back to me afterwards.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ever since the death I have been putting
two and two together. I have been anxious
to meet Mrs. Tarbot to ask her if she ever had
the medicine analyzed to find out why she
called it wrong. Then, Barbara dear, I don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>believe that Piers had heart disease. Don’t
you remember how he used to run and race,
and play tennis and croquet, and ride his pony
and his bicycle?</p>

<p class='c010'>“He could not have done all these things
if he had organic disease of the heart—I don’t
believe it. He was taken ill very suddenly,
and a favorite nurse of Tarbot’s was engaged
to look after him. She herself confessed in
my presence that there was something wrong
with the medicine which she handed to me to
give him. All these things might have been
of course merely incidents leading to nothing,
but on the night the child died a strange thing
happened. I was called to the door of the
dressing-room and given the boy’s medicine
again. The nurse said it would have a very
stimulating effect, and would take off the
weakness from which the child was suffering.
It did not do so—on the contrary, the boy died
a few moments afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he might have died in any case; and
three doctors examined his heart,” exclaimed
Barbara. “You make me feel uncomfortable
when you speak in this way, but I cannot at
present see that there is anything whatever to
account for your suspicions. If there really
is, the thing to do is to make inquiries, and so
set your mind at rest. I see that this is not a
mere question of nerves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, dear, I assure you it is not. I am torn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>between two opinions. I feel inclined one
moment to go straight ahead and sift the thing
to the bottom, and then again I hesitate, for I
have so little to go upon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you have nothing to go upon, you must
make up your mind to banish your suspicions,”
said Barbara, speaking in a resolute voice.
“They do you harm, Dick. You are not the
man you were. Now that the child is dead
a great responsibility devolves upon you, and
you ought to rise with courage to meet it. I
want you, Dick, to be the best landlord that
the Pelham property has ever had. I have
ideals which I never thought to have realized,
but if you will do your part, they may come to
pass.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish Piers was back in the world,” said
the young man. “I should be ten times
happier living with you, Barbara, in a little
house and struggling for briefs. Of course, if
the property and title had come to me in the
ordinary way——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, Dick, they have,” said Barbara, rising
as she spoke. “You will dwell on this matter
so long that your mind will really become
affected at last.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sit down,” said Pelham. He held out his
hand and drew her back to her seat close to
his side. “I have not quite told you all. Sit
close to me, Barbara. We must talk of this
in whispers.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Barbara drew nearer to her husband. The
balcony at this moment was absolutely deserted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you remember what happened immediately
after Piers’s death?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean? Of course, I remember
everything.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I allude to the night when the coffin was
brought home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara gave a slight shudder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was in the house then,” she said. “Mrs.
Pelham was very ill. It is true Nurse Hester
had arrived, but I liked to be with Mrs. Pelham,
and she was glad to have me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the night the coffin was brought in,
two days before the funeral, I called very late
to see you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I had gone to bed. The servant told
me of your visit in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I arrived between eleven and twelve at
night. I rang the bell, and the footman came
to answer the door. He told me that all the
household had gone to bed, and that he had
got up to answer my summons. I said I
should like to come in, as I wanted to verify
something in the library. I said I would let
myself out presently, and that he need not stay
up. Of course, he treated me just like one of
the family.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I went to the library and stayed there for
a little. My mind was full of suspicion, in a
turmoil and agony of uncertainty. I was only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>waiting for something more to go upon, in
order to have the whole thing sifted to the very
bottom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I stayed in the library for over half an
hour. You know it is far away from the rest
of the house. About half-past twelve I thought
I would go up to the room where the child
had died and try if I could find any of the
medicines. My idea was to secure a bottle
and get the contents analyzed. I naturally
supposed that the nurse would be in one of
the rooms, and meant to ask her to give me a
bottle with a little of the medicine which Piers
had last taken. I ran up-stairs. The house
was dark, for the electric light had been put
out, but I carried a candle. I opened the door
of the room where the dead child lay, and went
in. It did not take me a moment to switch on
the light, and I then saw that the coffin was on
the bed, and noticed with a start that the lid
was screwed down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seemed to me that it was strangely soon
to screw on the lid. I went over and stood by
the coffin. The nurse was nowhere to be seen.
I then went into the dressing-room and began
to search about for the medicine bottles, but
although they had been lying on the table
during Piers’s illness they had all been removed.
There were two cupboards in the room—one
was open, the other locked. In the open cupboard
were no bottles of any sort. I felt very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>much inclined to burst open the lock of the
other cupboard, but refrained. I feared the
noise might disturb Mrs. Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I left the room after being there for about
a quarter of an hour, not having effected my
purpose. As I was going down-stairs I was met
by the butler. He had also got up, as he said
he had heard the noise of people moving about
the house, and could not think what was the
matter. I told him at once that I had been
up to bid little Piers good-by.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Yes,’ said the man, ‘I’d like to go and
have a last look at the little gentleman myself,
sir.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘You cannot do so, Johnson,’ I answered.
‘They have screwed on the lid of the coffin
already.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘But it’s very soon,’ said the man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘It is very soon,’ I replied. He stared at
me as if he scarcely believed the evidence of
his own ears. I said nothing further, but left
the house. Barbara dear, how white you look!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, is there anything more?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only this. I happened to meet Tarbot the
next day, and told him that I had gone up to
bid little Piers good-by. I said that I was
surprised to see the lid already screwed on the
coffin. He said that circumstances made it
necessary. Tarbot certainly looked like an innocent
man—he was brisk and energetic, and
had just a natural degree of soberness about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>him. While I was with him I felt ashamed
of my suspicions, and could not speak about
what I dreaded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Time went by. I attended the funeral.
Tarbot also went to it. I hoped that my fears
would quickly die; but instead of their dying,
Barbara, they are strengthened day by day.
If nothing is done to relieve me I shall soon
be one of those curses of the nineteenth century—a
man of nerves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad you have spoken all that is in
your mind,” said Barbara; “and now I tell you
what we must do. All this must be cured
absolutely, and the only cure is plenty of occupation.
We have been long enough in
Switzerland; we will return home to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To London?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To London, if you like, for a day or two,
and then on to Pelham Towers or the Priory.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pelham Towers is the most important
place,” said Dick, “and I am sure the people
will be glad to welcome us. I have lived at the
Towers, as you know, a good deal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara rose to reenter the hotel. Just as she
was about to do so a man’s figure darkened
the window. He was tall, with black hair, a
thin face, and a kindly, shrewd, clever mouth.
He stared for a moment at Barbara, glanced
beyond her at Pelham, and then with a hearty
exclamation of surprise and pleasure came forward.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“Who would have thought of seeing you
here, Pelham?” he said. “Pray introduce me
to your wife.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carroll, this is luck!” cried Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara came forward at once when she
heard the name. She had never met Mr.
Carroll before, but he was a well-known
London lawyer, and also one of little Piers
Pelham’s guardians.</p>

<p class='c010'>The two men exchanged some commonplace
observations, and Barbara stood for a moment
listening to them and joining in herself occasionally.
Then, laying her hand on her
husband’s shoulder, she said that she was tired
and would go to her room, and the two men
were left alone together. Leaning over the
balcony, they lit their cigars and began to
smoke. Carroll, who had been silent for a
moment, spoke abruptly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When are you going home?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Back to London?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose so for a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad to hear it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t mind if I speak openly, do you,
Pelham?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course I don’t. But what do you mean?
I hold no secrets.” As Pelham spoke he
started and flushed—the memory of all his suspicions
with regard to Piers rushed over him.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Carroll, who had been gazing fixedly at him,
noticed his change of color.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are some ugly rumors about you in
London. You had better go there and show
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ugly rumors about me?” said Pelham.
“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it has got abroad—I daresay there’s
not a word of truth in it—but it is the talk of
more than one club that you signed a <em>post obit</em>
for a large sum just before that child, little
Piers, was taken ill. I don’t believe it for a
moment: and I denied it flatly. You are the
last man to put your hand to such a document.
What is the matter, old fellow?—you look ill.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it is true; I did sign a <em>post obit</em>,”
answered Pelham in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Carroll uttered a surprised exclamation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You astound me,” he said. “Then for
Heaven’s sake, go back to London at once.
This is not a time for you to hide yourself in
a corner.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <span class='large'>MRS. PELHAM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Pelhams returned home and took up
their quarters at Mrs. Evershed’s house in
Mark Place.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham had been in London two or three
days before he could muster sufficient courage
to visit Mrs. Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must come, Dick,” said his young
wife; “your keeping away looks strange.
Mrs. Pelham has been talking to mother about
you and wondering why you never come near
her. She sent us an invitation only yesterday,
and she wants us to take tea with her this
afternoon. I accepted her invitation for us
both. Come with me, and get it over.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham remained silent for a moment.
Then he said—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Barbara, it is best to get it over. I
will come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At the appointed hour they arrived at Ashley
Mansions. Mrs. Pelham was alone in the
old drawing-room where Dick had so often
greeted her in the presence of little Piers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara in her rich furs, her eyes sparkling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and the color of health and happiness on her
cheeks, made a lovely picture as she advanced
eagerly into the room. She held out both her
hands, and tears of sympathy filled her eyes.
She put her arms round the little widow’s neck
and kissed her. Mrs. Pelham received her
with effusion, but her real anxiety was to get
a glimpse of Dick.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah!” she said, “you have come at last.”
She looked full up into the young man’s face
and burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t think you would have left me so
long,” she continued. “I thought you would
have been a son to me now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She sobbed audibly. Pelham was visibly
affected. Mrs. Pelham sat down, and he placed
himself near her. Presently she held out one
of her hands and invited him to clasp it in his.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No one in all the world is as dear to me
as you are now,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought that under the circumstances
you would rather not see me,” said Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a strange thought to come to you!
You certainly were wrong. Do you think I
grudge you what once belonged to him? I
am not quite so base as that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dick has been in very low spirits since
little Piers’s death,” said Barbara suddenly.
“He felt his death dreadfully. He loved him
as if he were his own brother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know that,” said Mrs. Pelham, taking out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>her handkerchief and applying it afresh to her
eyes. “And now—I say it quite frankly, Dick—now
that God has seen fit to remove little
Piers, I am more glad that you should have
the property than any one else in the world.
If anything could reconcile me to the death
of my only boy, it is the thought that you are
his heir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you,” said Dick. “You are more
than good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you come and visit us at Pelham
Towers this winter, Mrs. Pelham?” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham looked attentively from one
young face to the other—Barbara’s full of eagerness,
fire and enthusiasm, Dick’s strangely
downcast.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I will come,” she answered. “Dick,
you feel all this too much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham walked to the mantelpiece. There
he stood fidgeting with one of the ornaments,
his back turned to Mrs. Pelham and Barbara.
Barbara saw that the interview was proving
too much for him. She was distressed and
alarmed at his state, and as soon as possible
rose to leave.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a short visit!” said Mrs. Pelham in
a fretful tone. “I hoped you would both stay
and have a long talk. There is so much that
we have to talk over together.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will come again to-morrow,” said Barbara
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>in her soft voice, glancing as she spoke
towards her husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is dreadfully upset,” she continued,
dropping her voice almost to a whisper. “I
will come by myself if I may.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When do you leave London?” asked Mrs.
Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On Saturday, I think. Don’t we go to
Pelham Towers on Saturday, Dick?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” replied Pelham. “We will both
come to say good-by before we leave London,
and we hope to see you, Mrs. Pelham, at the
Towers in the winter,” he added.</p>

<p class='c010'>The two women said a few more words to
each other, and then Barbara and her husband
found themselves outside the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>They walked as far as Mark Place.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shan’t come in just yet, Barbara,” said
Dick. “That visit has upset me—I shall go
for a walk. Ask your mother not to wait
dinner.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned immediately and left her. Barbara
went up-stairs to the drawing-room, where
her mother was waiting for her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you see Mrs. Pelham?” asked Mrs.
Evershed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad Dick went there at last.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara made no reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She is recovering, is she not?” said Mrs.
Evershed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“She seemed to me to be in very great
trouble,” replied Barbara. “Seeing Dick upset
her dreadfully.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He ought to have gone there long ago,”
said her mother. “His not doing so arouses
suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Arouses suspicion, mother?” echoed Barbara.
“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Barbara, you may as well know it—there
has been considerable talk about a <em>post
obit</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Post obit</em>—what is that?” asked Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a document in which a man makes
himself liable to pay away property which he
does not possess at the time, but which will
be his at the death of a relation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not understand,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, my dear, that is what your husband
has done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My husband has signed a <em>post obit</em>! I
think you must be wrong.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not wrong. Your husband promised
to pay a certain sum of money on the death of
Piers Pelham. It is always considered a shady
thing to do, and I cannot imagine how a man
like Dick could have been guilty of such an
indiscretion. It makes at the present moment
a handle for talk. I don’t like it, I must say
so frankly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara was silent. Her face had turned
very pale.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“The story as it reached my ears was something
as follows,” continued Mrs. Evershed.
“You remember how kind we thought Dr.
Tarbot when he lent me that ten thousand
pounds!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly, mother, and he was very kind.
I don’t like him for most things, but I always
did think he was generous about that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems, Barbara, that he was not quite
so generous as we imagined, for Dick—poor
fellow!—was implicated in the matter too.
Dr. Tarbot required some security for his
money. I had none to give him, and the security
he claimed was that Dick should pay
him as soon as he came in for the property.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For what property?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Barbara, my dear, how silly you are! The
Pelham property.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you sure you are right?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Positive. You can ask your husband yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When did this happen?” asked the girl.
She was trembling visibly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sit down, dear. Really, Barbara, you are
a most impulsive person. There’s nothing so
dreadful in what I tell you—it may be an indiscretion,
of course, but many men do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not men like Dick,” said Barbara—she
spoke with an effort.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear child, notwithstanding your quixotic
views with regard to that husband of yours,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>you must accept facts. Dick signed a document
which is called a <em>post obit</em>, in which he
promised to pay back the capital of ten thousand
pounds to Dr. Tarbot whenever he came
in for the Pelham estates.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When did he sign the document?” asked
Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the day the loan was made to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lady Pelham walked to the window and
stood there looking out. Everything seemed
dim and strange. She had a queer singing in
her ears. She could hear nothing for a moment
but this tempestuous noise. She turned
and faced her mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am going out, mother,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it is so late, dear, and you have only
just come in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will tell you presently.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Barbara, are you going to have secrets
from me, your mother?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will tell you presently. I cannot now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara left the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Evershed walked to the window and
watched her as she crossed the little quadrangle
which stood in front of Mark Place.
The girl went down a street, which led into a
wide thoroughfare.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How queerly she takes it,” thought the
mother. “Many a man has done a similar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>thing before now. I am sorry Barbara is so
sensitive. Doubtless those two will have their
first quarrel over this matter. How did the
rumor get out? Such private things as these
are never known as a rule. What can it
mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile Barbara, her heart on fire, and
the noise of its loud beating quite audible in
her ears, walked rapidly in the direction of
Tarbot’s house in Harley Street. She arrived
there about six o’clock. When the servant
answered her summons she asked if the doctor
was in. The man said no.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When do you expect him to return?”
asked Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not until late, madam. He had to go into
the country to attend a patient.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara hesitated for a moment; then with
reluctance she put her next question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is Mrs. Tarbot at home?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will inquire, madam, if you will wait a
moment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If she is at home I should like to see her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What name shall I say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lady Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man invited Barbara in and went up-stairs
to make the inquiry. He returned
quickly to say that his mistress was at home,
and would be pleased to see Lady Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara followed him up the richly carpeted
stairs into a magnificent drawing-room on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>first floor. This room had been newly furnished,
and showed excellent taste in all its
arrangements. The electric light was subdued
by golden silk draperies over the pomegranate
shaped globes, the curtains were drawn before
the large windows, there was a fire in the grate.
From the depths of a deep arm-chair a tall
woman dressed in black rose as Barbara entered.
She had a pale face and radiant red-gold
hair. She came a step or two forward
and half hesitated whether to hold out her
hand or not. Barbara advanced to meet her.
For a moment she could not recognize in this
graceful and perfectly dressed lady Nurse
Ives, whom she had last seen at Ashley Mansions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is this really you?” was the exclamation
which burst involuntarily from her lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, it is I,” replied Mrs. Tarbot. “I am
changed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are transformed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Tarbot gave a faint smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Won’t you sit down?” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you,” answered Barbara. She
seated herself and threw up her veil.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is good of you to pay me this visit,” said
Tarbot’s wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have come to you because your husband
is out. This is not an ordinary call.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed!” Mrs. Tarbot looked at Barbara
with an intense and hungry stare.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“I will treat whatever you tell me as confidential,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara looked full at her. Her very voice
had altered, her manners were those of a refined
and well-educated woman. Her dress,
black, and of the softest lace and silk, scarcely
rustled as she moved.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now as she returned Barbara’s gaze her eyes
grew bright. The eyes themselves were of a
very pale blue, painfully deficient in color by
daylight, but at night the pupils were apt to
dilate, and in the midst of the white face the
eyes glowed dark, somber and watchful.
Barbara thought she had never seen a more
peculiar or a stronger type of face. She was
so much engaged in the amazing discovery of
the changed Nurse Ives that she could not
speak for a moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you got over your astonishment?”
said Mrs. Tarbot at last, speaking very
softly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara started and colored.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” she replied. “I
hope you will forgive me. You are so transformed
that I did not know you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is true, Lady Pelham,” was the slow
reply; “I am as much altered as the circumstances
of my life have changed. When you
last saw me I was only a nurse. My parentage
is humble, my mother is a very humble person
indeed. She is an excellent woman and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>plenty of character, but she belongs to the
peasantry of our county.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is your county?” asked Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cornwall.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother has a little cottage in Cornwall
by the sea coast. She pays ten pounds a year
for it. She lives not very far from Falmouth.
I remember the time when there was extreme
difficulty in meeting that ten pounds rent.
Then I went away and was trained as a nurse,
and——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you married Dr. Tarbot?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I married Dr. Tarbot. I am sorry he
is out. He would doubtless have answered
whatever question you intend to ask better
than I could.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wished to see him with regard to a curious
rumor which is afloat, but I have something
else to say to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that? I am all attention.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“May I trust you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is about my husband. He is not well.
He is troubled by a nervous ailment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Tarbot looked watchful and eager.
She no longer lay back in her chair; she sat
upright, her thin hands were folded on her lap,
the jewels with which her fingers were loaded
shone in the firelight. Her eyes, filled with
bold intentness, were fixed on Barbara’s white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>face. All the remarkable and gracious beauty
of the young face was torture to the jealous
heart of the other woman. She saw that a new
development in her strange history was imminent,
and roused herself, bracing every nerve
to meet it. “Yes,” she said, “a nervous
ailment. This is the age for such maladies.
We live too fast, we put too much into our
lives, nerves get overwrought, they give way.
Our grandmothers vegetated, they did not
know the meaning of nerves. A young man,
rich, in the prime of youth, who has just married
the girl he loves, ought not to suffer from
nervous troubles.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My husband cannot get over the death of
the child.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is haunted by strange fears in connection
with that death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What I say, and I have come now to ask
you to tell me frankly and fully, knowing that
God is present and is listening to us, what the
child really died of.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Acute disease of the heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish you would tell Dick so. His mind
is in a strange state of confusion. If you were
to see him and repeat the words you have just
told me it might give him untold relief.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My word alone would not do that. When
Dr. Tarbot signed the death certificate he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>spoke of the cause of death as aortic disease—that
means disease of the aortic valve of the
heart, a species of heart disease which invariably
ends suddenly. Dr. Williamson and Sir
Richard Spears were of the same opinion.
My word goes for nothing. Let your husband
see the great specialists who examined the
boy’s heart within twenty-four hours of his
death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am greatly obliged to you,” said Barbara.
She rose to go as she spoke. “I will tell Dick
what you say. Yes, he must see the doctors.
Their verdict will set his mind at rest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad you came to see me,” said Mrs.
Tarbot, “and if in the future I can help you,
pray command me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But how can you help me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean this. From what you say, your
husband is suffering from nerve depression.
Nothing else can account for the curious state
you have half described. The doctors whom
he consults may set his mind at rest, but if after
seeing them his troubles return, his complaint
ought to be treated as something physical, an
ailment of the body which requires cure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But how can such a thing be cured? How
can a thought, a dominant thought, be banished?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It can, and—I can do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You, Mrs. Tarbot? You?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“Yes, I. Did I ever tell you that I spent
three years of my life in Paris?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did. I was one of the principal assistants
of the great Dr. Weismann. When he lived
he was the greatest mesmerist, the greatest
hypnotist of his day. He accomplished more
cures by hypnotism than I can describe to
you. Now, the hypnotism of suggestion would,
in case of need, cure your husband.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I don’t believe in it, nor, I am sure,
does he.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may come to believe in it yet. When
you do, send for me, and I will help you.
I will do my best for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara promised, feeling as she did so a
vague sense of coming trouble. Soon afterwards
she took her leave and hurried home
as quickly as she could.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>When Pelham left his wife he went into the
Park. It was a foggy evening with frost in
the air, and the fog was densest in the Park, as
it always is. He walked under the trees
watching the gas lamps, which shone feebly
through the foggy atmosphere. He did not
heed where he was going, his whole soul was
absorbed in anxious thought. There were no
nervous terrors now visible on his face. He
held himself erect, and walked quickly. After
a time he stood still under a lamp post, a look
of resolution and strength visiting his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll do it,” he said to himself. “I’ll do it,
and I won’t waste another moment. The time
has come for action, and I will act.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He left the Park, walked rapidly to the
nearest telegraph office and sent a telegram to
his wife:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t sit up for me should I be late.—Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This being despatched, he walked as fast as
he could in the direction of Ashley Mansions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>He ran up the steps of the well-known house
and rang the bell.</p>

<p class='c010'>The old butler smiled with pleasure when
he saw his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mistress is dining at present, sir; but
she’ll be sure to see you. This way, Sir
Richard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man ushered him into the big dining-room.
It was a somber apartment, with a
dark, old-fashioned flock paper on the walls
and heavy moreen curtains to the windows.
The house was lit throughout with electric
light, but even that failed to make the room
look cheerful. A portrait of little Piers done
by a celebrated painter had the place of honor
over the mantelpiece. The picture had been
executed about six months before the child’s
death. The boy in rich velvet, a Vandyke
collar surrounding his soft little neck, his dark
hair flung back from his brow, was standing
with one arm over the neck of a favorite
boarhound. He was looking straight out into
the world with his eager—almost too eager—gaze.
The eyes, like those in every good
portrait, followed the inmates of the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Pelham entered they fixed themselves
immediately on him. The young man was
startled. He had forgotten that this speaking
portrait of Piers existed. His heart gave a
bound, he looked up at the picture as though
he meant to say something reassuring to it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>The sparkling, vivid, lifelike glance continued
to follow the young man. Mrs. Pelham, who
was seated at a small table just under the
picture and close to the fire, rose and went to
meet him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, Dick, this is nice and friendly,” she
cried. “Sit down. You’ll have dinner with
me, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall be very pleased,” answered Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lay a place at once for Sir Richard,” said
Mrs. Pelham, turning to the butler.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man hurried off to obey. A moment
latter Pelham was pretending to eat; inwardly
he was all on wires. The portrait with its
speaking eyes oppressed him, he longed to be
in another room.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last the meal came to an end.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Serve coffee in the drawing-room,” said
Mrs. Pelham to the butler. “Will you come
this way, Dick! It is so kind of you to come
back informally, just like you used to do in the
old days when dear little Piers was alive.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I came back because I wanted to ask you
a question,” said Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it?” asked Mrs. Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want to go up to Piers’s nursery.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course you can, my dear fellow; but
what for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has the room been disarranged since his
death?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“Put in order, Dick—nothing more. I am
not going to have that dear room touched, at
any rate, not for a long time. By and by
when you have a little son of your own, he
shall come and stay here and——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham’s tears flowed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t talk of it, don’t think of it,” said
Pelham. “This death has been a frightful
blow to me. I must tell you what I feel about
it. There are moments when I am almost
inclined to shirk the whole thing—to go away.
I hate the property which has come to me
through the child’s death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is very good of you to feel like that, but
you must get over it, Dick—you must really.
Even though he was my son I cannot let his
death ruin your life. But now, what do you
want to go to his room for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Must I tell you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not if you would rather not. Perhaps
you wish me to give you something to remember
him by, and I will with pleasure.
Shall I come with you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would rather go alone, and I will tell
you quite frankly the reason: I wish to examine
the boy’s medicine bottles.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham started back.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What in the world do you mean?” she
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am dreadfully sorry to distress you,” said
Pelham, “but I am particularly anxious to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>the bottle out of which Piers had his last dose
of medicine. Is it still up-stairs?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not. Of course, my dear Dick, I
would gratify you if I could.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been anxious for some time to see
that last bottle of medicine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A nervous man’s fears. Don’t ask me
more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your fears, Dick?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham’s eyes became dilated with a
queer expression of intense distress.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t think anything about it,” he answered.
“I am nervous; and to have that
special medicine analyzed would set my mind
at rest. I know that the medicines were always
kept in a cupboard in the dressing-room. Let
me go to that cupboard. Give me the key.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But this is most alarming,” said Mrs.
Pelham. “I think you must be out of your
mind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me have the key of the cupboard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The cupboard is open, and the medicines
have been removed. Dr. Tarbot was here a
fortnight ago. He asked me to give him the
key of that special cupboard. He told me
that there was something peculiar about Piers’s
death—of course we all know that he died of
acute heart disease, or something of the sort,
but Dr. Tarbot was anxious to make copious
notes of the case, and he had lost one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>prescriptions. He took all the medicine bottles
away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>While Mrs. Pelham was speaking Dick’s face
grew hard and gray.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If that is the case there is no use in troubling
you,” he said. “Tarbot will tell me what
I desire to know. Good night.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>When Pelham left the house in Ashley
Mansions it was not yet ten o’clock. He
paused for a moment on the pavement to look
at his watch and consult with himself. The
result of his brief thought was that he turned
with resolute steps in the direction of Harley
Street. Ten minutes after he left Ashley Mansions
he was ringing the bell of Luke Tarbot’s
house. The door was opened, he asked if the
doctor was in. The servant replied in the
affirmative.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What name shall I say?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say that Sir Richard Pelham wishes to
speak to Dr. Tarbot for a moment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sir Richard was asked to step into the hall,
and the servant went hurriedly into a room
which opened on to the hall at the left side.
The next moment Tarbot came out to meet
Dick and to welcome him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come in, Sir Richard,” he said. “I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>very glad to see you. Do you mind joining
me in my smoking-den? I can give you an
excellent cigar and a hearty welcome.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot’s manner was cordial. The two men
entered the smoking-room. Pelham declined
a cigar. His manner was full of reserve, and
intensely gloomy. Tarbot saw at a glance that
he intended to make himself disagreeable. He
gave his guest one very keen flash out of his
deeply set eyes, and immediately afterwards
put on his most guarded manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>It had been the lot of the great surgeon to
see all sorts and conditions of men. For years
now he had read the human countenance in
its intricate and many phases. He saw that
Dick was much troubled and desperate. This
was no call of mere politeness. But it was not
Tarbot’s cue to take the initiative, and he
waited for his guest to speak.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have come here to-night, Dr. Tarbot, to
ask you a special question.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What may that be?” asked Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have I to thank you for a very unpleasant
rumor which is afloat with regard to me in my
club?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must explain yourself. I do not
understand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is this. It is known in the club that I
signed a <em>post obit</em> a fortnight before the death
of my little cousin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot slightly shifted his position.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“I did not know that the rumor had got
afloat,” he said. “I am certainly innocent of
propagating it. But are you sure it is known?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. I was first told of it by Carroll,
whom I met at the hotel at Glion, where my
wife and I stayed. He begged me to return
to London as quickly as possible in order to
contradict the gossip which was afloat. I did
come back, and I find on my arrival that matters
are even more unpleasant than I had believed
possible.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How the rumor got about is more than I
can tell you,” he replied. “I can only assure
you once more that I am not responsible. I
should naturally wish to hide a matter in which
I myself am implicated. You understand,
Pelham, that it affects me as much as you.
My advice to you is this: don’t take the slightest
notice. Live it down—there is nothing
in it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is unpleasant and undesirable,” said
Dick, “and the man who has caused it to be
spread is my enemy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then find him,” said Tarbot lightly.
“Find him, and vent your spleen upon him.
Will you change your mind and have a cigar?
I can recommend this brand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, thank you. I only smoke with my
friends.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What am I to understand by that?” asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Tarbot. As he spoke he looked Dick full in
the face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought we were friends,” continued
Tarbot after a moment’s pause.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” answered Dick. “I must be frank
at a moment like the present. I dislike you,
Dr. Tarbot. I have an antipathy to you—what
is more, I distrust you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must give me a reason for those last
words. Why do you distrust me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I intend to speak fully. The child’s death
has distressed me much. Yesterday I got a
copy of the certificate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because I am not satisfied with the reason
you gave for the death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you ever qualify as a medical man?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never; but I use my common sense, and
I repeat that I am not satisfied with the reason
you gave for the death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You state that the boy died from heart
disease.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He did—from aortic disease.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I say that he never had heart disease.
I knew him well, almost from his birth. He
was delicate, but he had no organic complaint
of any sort. It is just possible that disease of
the heart may be developed within a fortnight,
but on that point I should like to ask the opinion
of another doctor.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>“Why so? Is not my word as good as
another’s? Such instances are rare, but not
impossible.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham was silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go on,” said Tarbot after a pause. “Say
all that is in your mind. You have gone too
far now to draw back. Your impression is
that the child did not die of heart disease.
You at least admit that he is dead?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Heaven help me, yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That being the case, what did he die of?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot tell you. I wish I could.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it your impression that he came by his
death unduly?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have harbored such a suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whom do you suspect?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham’s face flushed, but his eyes looked
straight into Tarbot’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps you can answer that,” he replied;
“but whatever the cause of death, I wish to
have all the circumstances relating to the
child’s last illness closely investigated.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not know what more you can do. I
signed the certificate. I am ready to abide by
my decision. I certified that Piers Pelham
died from aortic disease. My opinion was
corroborated by Dr. Williamson and Sir
Richard Spears. In what position are you that
you place your opinion against three such
authorities?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am in no position whatever, but still I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>hold my own thoughts, and I wish to have
something done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To have the medicine which the boy last
took analyzed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Talking of that,” said Tarbot, “don’t forget
that you yourself gave that last dose of
medicine to the boy. You went to fetch the
bottle, you took the medicine to the child, he
received it from your hands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“True, but what of that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Much or little according to circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not understand you,” said Pelham.
“It matters little who gave the medicine to
the child. I wish to have it analyzed. Nothing
else will set my mind at rest. I have just
been to Mrs. Pelham’s house for the purpose
of securing the bottle, but I find that you forestalled
me, and that you have the medicine in
your own keeping.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you want it for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To have it analyzed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you agree with me?” said Dick
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t agree with you, but because I am
taking copious notes of Sir Piers Pelham’s
death I wish to have the medicine analyzed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you do it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you do it now?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What if I compel you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Compel me! My good fellow, you are
talking nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham was fast losing his self-control: he
leaped forward and seized Tarbot by the arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Scoundrel!” he said. “Notwithstanding
that certificate, I have my reasons for suspecting
you. Analyze that medicine at once before
my eyes, or, by heaven, I’ll have you in
a court of justice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must be mad, Pelham,” said Tarbot
calmly. “I will analyze the medicine, certainly,
but at my own good time and pleasure.
Now leave the house. Your words are insulting.
You forget yourself. Too great a portion
of this world’s riches has overbalanced your
brain. I have heard of such cases before.
When you can exercise self-control I will speak
to you again.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE PRICE OF HIS SIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Pelham never quite remembered how he
got into the street. He was only conscious of
having completely lost his self-control, of a
mad whirl of emotions, which deprived him,
for the moment, of all ordinary sense and
prudence. A loathing for the man with whom
he had been conversing, a certainty that there
was a real foundation for his appalling fears,
both combined to overbalance a brain already
strained to the utmost. When the cold night
air, however, blew on his heated forehead he
quickly recovered himself, and seeing that he
could do nothing further went home.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having seen Pelham out, Tarbot returned
to his smoking-room. There was a grim determination
about his thin lips and a frown
between his brows—thought was working hard
in his active brain. After a short time given
to reflection, he knocked the ashes out of
his pipe, laid it in its accustomed place on
the mantelpiece, turned off the electric light
and went up-stairs.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>He entered the drawing-room. He knew
that here he should find the woman he had
lately married. He found her stretched in an
easy chair beside the fire. Her hands were
lying idly in her lap, her eyes were shut—she
was fast asleep. Tarbot had always a quiet
tread. He now advanced almost on tiptoe
and stood looking down at her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The price I have paid for my sin,” he muttered
under his breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>He drew a chair forward and softly seated
himself. The woman was unconscious of his
presence, and he could look at her; he could
fill his soul with loathing of her, and drink
the cup which he had prepared for his own
lips to the dregs. His face was white as he
gazed at Clara. She did not look well in her
sleep. There were haggard lines round her
lips—lines which had come far too soon, for
she was still quite a young woman. Her
cheeks were hollow, she coughed now and
then. Her dead-white complexion, with its
disfiguring freckles, gave her face the look of
the dead.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would she were dead!” muttered Tarbot.
“Would she were——”</p>

<p class='c010'>From the face he looked down at the hands,
the arms, the outlines of the thin limbs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is a certain grace about her,” he
said to himself, “but it is the grace of the
panther, the tigress. If I married another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>woman now I should commit bigamy. I could
curse her.” He bent a little nearer, and then
a queer and eager light began to grow in his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe it is true,” he said to himself.
He rose softly, left the room, and returned
with his stethoscope. Clara’s dress was partly
open at the thin neck. With the delicate
hand of the practised surgeon, he was able to
apply the stethoscope to her chest without
rousing her. He listened attentively, not
making a thorough examination of her lungs,
but one sufficient for his purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is too true,” he muttered. He let the
lace fall back over her heaving chest, and
looked at her again. The woman stirred in
her sleep. Her long training as a nurse
had accustomed her to wake up bright and
alert. Tarbot put the stethoscope in his
pocket. Clara opened her eyes and started
upright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am very sorry I slept,” she said. “Have
you been long here? Shall I ring for coffee—the
servants have not yet gone to bed?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, thanks. I want to talk to you, Clara.
Are you wide awake? Can you attend to
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly. I am very wide awake. I have
had my little nap. I do not need more sleep
to-night—that is, if you really wish to speak
to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“I want to say something, but I shall not
keep you long.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you been in the room many minutes?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Two or three.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You were seated here close to me, looking
at me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye, I looked at you. By the way, Clara,
I wish you would not wear those diamonds
every night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not? Do you object?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do. It is bad form. You are not going
out anywhere. Only a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parvenu</span></i> would
load herself with jewels in the way you do.
You coughed, too, in your sleep, and when
you did I noticed the diamonds. Do you ever
feel ill, or tired, or weary?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of late I have done so from time to
time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought as much. I must send you to
a warmer climate, but we will talk of that later
on. You cannot leave England at present.
You are useful to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know that, Luke. I am glad to be useful
to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then take care of yourself, and don’t go
out too much at night. By the way, does that
cough hurt?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A little. Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will only tell you that you ought to be
careful. A cough is a thing no one should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>trifle with. Your mother is alive, I think I
heard you say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is your father?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What did your father die of?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Consumption. ‘Galloping consumption’
they called it down in Cornwall.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, I see!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara’s eyes began to dilate with a sort of
terror.<a id='t201'></a> Tarbot looked away from her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We won’t talk any more of your health
now,” he said after a pause. “We will get to
business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She gave him a pleading glance, and then
with a heavy sigh lowered her eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am all attention,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pelham has been here,” said Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is he here now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; I turned him out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good Heavens, Luke! Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because he insulted me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To all intents and purposes, he accused
me of the murder of Sir Piers Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nonsense! He accused you! Why
should he think any foul play had taken place?
Impossible!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nevertheless it is true. The man is an
utter fool. I always thought him so, but I
find there is a bit of the knave in him as well.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>He maintains that the child did not come by
his death by ordinary means. He is moving
heaven and earth in this cursed business.
Clara, it is full time for us to be up and stirring.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She had risen from her chair, her thin hands
worked convulsively, the rings on her fingers
flashed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hate all that finery,” said the man irritably.
“I repeat, that your wearing it is bad
form. Now listen to me. Pelham must be
arrested in a fortnight for the murder of his
cousin!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Luke, no, it cannot be.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It shall be, Clara.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I forbid it,” said the woman. “It is not
in the bargain,” she continued. She brought
out her words with almost a stutter—she was
trembling so hard. “It is not in the bargain,”
she repeated. “Six months was the
bargain, six months after marriage. I for
bid you to deal the blow a day before the
time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must be mad, Clara. You must see
for yourself that circumstances change. If I
do not have Pelham arrested he will turn the
tables on me. Oh, I know I am safe enough,
but I cannot afford delay. Who would have
thought that Pelham, a sleepy sort of fellow——”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“An alert lawyer, you mean,” interrupted
Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, you think so! He fascinates you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is an innocent man and a good man,”
replied Mrs. Tarbot. “I like him well because
he loved that child, because when the
child died Mr. Pelham had a sense, not of rejoicing,
but of sorrow. He is a good man,
and when you strike him you do a fiendish
deed. Give it up, Luke, give it up, and I will
serve you to my dying day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give it up! But I married you for the
sake of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye, I know that. Then you are inexorable?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He made no reply. He was taller than his
wife, and he was looking down at her. The
expression in his eyes caused her to turn aside.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I forgot for a moment,” she said at last
slowly, “that I had united myself to a devil.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Think me one if you will,” replied Tarbot.
“Upon my word, I would rather you thought
me a devil than a saint—it is less mawkish.
Bah! when I remember that I married you
for better for worse, till death us do part, I can
scarcely contain myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot walked to the other end of the room.
When he came back a new expression had
come over Clara’s face. All sentiment had
died out of it—it was hard and shrewd and
businesslike as his own.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>“Well,” he said, “you look better now. I
have much to say. Sit down at this table and
I will place myself opposite to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She did what he told her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Begin,” she said. “What have you to tell
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“First of all, I shall analyze that medicine.
I shall, of course, discover the hyocene. I will
acquaint Mrs. Pelham with the fact, and get
her to take the necessary steps to have Pelham
arrested.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When do you propose that he shall be
arrested?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is Thursday, and he goes to Pelham
Towers on Saturday. The arrest can take
place in the course of next week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suppose it does,” said Clara slowly: “what
will happen next?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will be brought back to London and
examined before the magistrate of the district
in which little Piers died. Your evidence and
mine will do the rest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My evidence?” said Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course. You will have to prove that
you gave Pelham the medicine, and that you
remained in the dressing-room while he administered
it to the boy. What is the matter
with you to-night? Why do you hesitate and
look so queer? If at the last moment you turn
traitress, you shall——”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man did not finish the sentence, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>there came a look into his eyes which caused
Clara’s heart to sink.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will fulfil my part of the bargain. I will
keep my word,” she said at last slowly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s right. Now you are returning to
your senses.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you must also keep your part,” she
continued. “The promises you made were
these: I was to become your wife, and Sir
Richard Pelham was to be unmolested for six
months.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remember quite well that you made that
a condition,” said Tarbot. “It always seemed
to me an unnecessary and foolish one, but
until to-night I never considered it carefully.
Circumstances alter matters. In a case like this
we cannot adhere strictly to a bargain. We
are both in danger—in extreme danger—we
have to fight, remember, for our lives.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“True,” she answered. She lowered her
eyes, to raise them the next moment and fix
them on her husband’s face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pelham must be arrested next week,” repeated
Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, Luke! Not so soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Clara, my word must be law in this matter.
When our lives are in jeopardy we cannot
afford to play the fool for a matter of mere
sentiment. I tell you, if I do not have Pelham
arrested he will turn the tables on
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“He will not, for his fears will soon be over.
His apprehensions will sink out of sight, he
will go down to his property and be a happy
man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If, Luke, I can quiet all Sir Richard Pelham’s
suspicions, will you delay the evil moment?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t understand what you are talking
about.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nor can I explain; but I think I shall succeed.
Now go on—what will happen after Sir
Richard has been before the magistrate?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will be remanded, in order that the
Home Secretary may give an order for the exhumation
of the child’s body.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara turned whiter than ever. She trembled
all over.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the matter with you?” said her
husband. “You are not the woman you were
a few months ago. If I had known that I was
really about to unite myself to such a vacillating,
poor, weak—what is wrong?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing. I trembled because I suddenly
thought of the ace of trumps.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The ace of trumps! Good heavens! Are
you mad?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Luke, I am sane—quite sane. I only
remembered that I hold the ace of trumps in
my hand, and therefore I have no real cause
for fear. You will be obliged to do what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>I wish. You must not have Sir Richard arrested
next week—not for a month or two
months.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let it be a bargain, then,” said Tarbot.
“Provided Pelham does not go to extremities,
provided his present suspicions are lulled
to rest, I am willing to let the matter lie
over until Christmas. Will that content
you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is better than nothing,” said Clara very
slowly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But remember the condition. His suspicions
about me must die out, or at least they
must not be acted upon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think I shall succeed,” said Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it is a bargain then. I am going
to analyze the medicine now. Good
night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot rose, and a moment later left the
room. Clara stood where he had left her.
One of her thin hands drummed on the little
table near which she was standing. Her
thoughts were very busy. After a time she
rose and went to her secretary. She took out
a sheet of headed notepaper and envelope, and
sitting down wrote a note. This note was to
Barbara Pelham.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Lady Pelham</span>,—The advice I gave
you to-day I want to enforce by a letter. I have
thought much of you since your visit. Your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>husband is in a highly nervous condition, but
he has no cause whatever for his fears. Why
should he not set them completely at rest by
doing as I suggest, and asking the opinions of
Dr. Williamson and Sir Richard Spears? He
might also go to the chemist and get a copy of
the prescription of the last medicine given to
the child. Would you suggest this to him
without bringing my name into the matter?
After receiving the information which he will
doubtless get from the two great specialists
and from the chemist, if his fears still remain,
please communicate with me, for I can give
him a treatment which will assuredly put him
into a healthier frame of mind. I would rather
not use this last remedy unless essential.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yours, with much sympathy,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Clara Tarbot</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Having written the letter, Clara herself went
out to post it. The servants had gone to bed.
She wrapped a shawl round her head and
walked quickly down Harley Street. She
slipped the letter into the pillar box and returned
home. Her mind was comparatively
at rest. She had just reached her hall door
when a hand was laid on her arm. She turned
round quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Clara, well! And so you were about
to cut your own mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mother,” cried Clara with a start, “What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>have you come to town for? What is the
matter? Anything wrong?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing, Clara, nothing. I’ve only come
to talk to you. I am coming into your house,
into your grand house. I don’t care about
your grandeur, but I’m coming in to see you,
for I’ve got something to say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come in, of course, mother. I shall be
delighted to welcome you. Come up-stairs to
the drawing-room.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara closed the hall door, and walked up
the grand staircase accompanied by her
mother. They entered the drawing-room, the
little woman immediately dropping a curtsey.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A mercy me!” she cried. “A deal of rugs
and curtains and fine furniture all over the
place, but the air smothering to the breathing
all the same. Clara, I came to say that the
child——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you want to talk on private matters,
mother, we had better go to my bedroom.
You will sleep here, of course.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I have a lodging outside. I couldn’t
have a wink of sleep in a grand sort o’ place
like this, but I have come to say——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will talk in my bedroom, mother.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <span class='large'>“HONOR BRIGHT.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Clara took her mother to her bedroom.
A bright fire glowed in the grate, the bed
was turned down, and everything looked soft,
luxurious, and the very height of luxury.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A deary me!” said the old woman again—she
dropped two curtseys—one to the bed
and another to the fire. “I never held with
grandeur. It’s all very well for them as was
born to it, but folks like you and me, Clary,
we ain’t meant to have it, and it don’t agree
with us. Why, you’re the color of a duck’s
egg in complexion now, and your freckles
seem to have spread.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, mother, what do you want?” said
Clara. “What have you come about?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye, aye, that’s the mystery,” said little
Mrs. Ives, her small eyes dancing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is there anything wrong with the child?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll hear in a minute, my deary dear.
Oh, I’ll sit near you if you wish, but not close
to the fire—it shrivels up the complexion, and
it’s making you as green as can be.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“What have you got to say?” exclaimed
Mrs. Tarbot. She had great difficulty in restraining
herself from using angry words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You was always one for your tempers,
Clara. But never mind, I has come to say——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What, mother?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That I have brought the child back to
London.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And why, may I ask?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because he wished to see the place where
he was accustomed to live, and why should I
fret him—the dear lamb?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where have you taken him? You know
I gave up my rooms in Brand’s Buildings.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ain’t gone back there. I has took a nice
lodging for myself and the boy at 30 Hester
Street, just over the way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You ought not to have done it, mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The child was restless,” continued the old
woman. “He’s a bonny boy, and I ain’t got
his secret out of him, but I very near have.
I thought it best to come and tell you, and you
had better come round and have a look at him
in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll come now,” said Clara. “You wait a
minute. I must look into this matter directly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She went to her wardrobe, opened it, and
took out an old bonnet which she had not
worn since her marriage, and also a long cloak.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can’t you wait till the morning?” said the
mother.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“No; I have other things to attend to then.
I’ll come with you now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The old woman made no further objection.
Clara opened the door of her bedroom and,
accompanied by Mrs. Ives, went down-stairs.
The servants had gone to bed, for the hour
was nearly midnight. Mrs. Tarbot took a latch-key
from a hook in the hall, and slipped it into
her pocket; then she opened the door and
went out.</p>

<p class='c010'>The two women did not take long in reaching
No. 30 Hester Street. Most of the lights
in the house were out, but in reply to their
ring a woman with a dirty dress and red
face opened the door. Mrs. Ives nodded to
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m bringing a friend of mine to see the
little gentleman,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman made no response, and Clara
and Mrs. Ives went up-stairs together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You should not speak of me as a friend of
yours, mother,” said Clara in a whisper as they
were going up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And why not? If my own darter ain’t a
friend, I don’t know who is. I were very near
saying, I ha’ brought my darter to see the
little boy, but out of respect for your ladyship
I said friend. Now here we be.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They paused on the third landing, and Mrs.
Ives opened the door and went in. Clara
followed her. The room was small and shabby.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“You ought not to have taken the boy to a
place of this sort,” said Mrs. Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not? You never told me that he
come of gentle folk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You might have guessed that for yourself.
The child must be well taken care of. He
can’t stay here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s for you to settle, Clary. In London
the child wishes to be, and in London he
must be.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mother, when you talk like that you aggravate
me past bearing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives walked across the sitting-room
and threw open the door of the bedroom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you go and wake him,” she said.
“He’s strong now—brown as a nut and as handsome
as a picture. Come along, we’ll have a
look at him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives lit a candle and they went into
the bedroom. The boy was lying on a small
bed which had been made up in a corner of
the room. Clara bent over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The child in his sleep looked like an angel.
Once he stirred, and when he did so that thing
within her which no one else had ever brought
to life began to make itself apparent. Her
feeling for Tarbot was passion, but her feeling
for the boy was love, pure and holy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush, hush! don’t wake him,” she said;
but her words came too late. The old woman
made a hasty movement, knocking over a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>table as she did so. The boy started in his
sleep, opened his eyes and looked full at Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am so glad you have come back again,”
he cried. The next instant his soft arms were
round her neck, and she felt his kisses on her
thin cheek.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m so glad you have come back,” he repeated,
“and I have kept it—I have really.
It’s wonderful, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear little Piers,” said Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you going to stay with me? I’d like
it awfully; I have a lot of things I want to talk
to you about. You know all my secrets, and
it would be a real comfort to talk to you.
Please, grannie (nurse, I always call your
mother ‘grannie’), please, grannie, go out of
the room. I want to say things to my nurse—oh,
I forgot, you don’t want me to call you
‘nurse’ any more, do you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t mind, Piers; you may call me
‘nurse’ if you like. I’ll stay with you for a
little. Mother, you can go into the sitting-room.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, can I? Seems to me I’m hustled about
to please everybody but myself,” said the old
woman. “All right, I’ll go. You don’t mind
if I leave the door ajar, do you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Please shut it, mother, and don’t bother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I’m a bother, am I? Your temper
gets worse and worse, Clara. But I’m going,
I’m going.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>She left the room, shutting the door noisily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She’s very cross with you,” said little Piers.
“But she’s not cross with me, and I love her
awfully.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad of that, dear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I went with grannie this morning to look
at my real home,” continued Piers. “I didn’t
tell her which house it was, but I stared at it,
and p’r’aps she saw the direction my eyes were
looking in. I did so long to run across and
ring the bell and rush up to mother and hug
her, but I didn’t because I had promised you.
Honor bright, you know, honor bright.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, honor bright, Piers,” said Mrs. Tarbot.
Her brows were knit, and she was gazing anxiously
across the little room. Her mind was
full of perplexity and dread.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want to see mother so dreadfully,” continued
the child. “I dream of her at night,
and I want to see Dick. It’s strange they
don’t any of them write. When may I go back
to them, nurse?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Piers, I am sorry, but I must disappoint you.
You’ll be a brave lad, I know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I’ll be brave, but what do you want
to disappoint me about?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have some sad news for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sad?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You cannot go back to your mother,
Piers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“And you must not go into the street where
she used to live; you must not stand any
more outside the house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because your mother is not there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She has gone away for the present, and your
Cousin Dick and your friend Barbara have also
gone away. They will come back by and by—by
and by when you are really cured—but
it takes a long time to cure a little chap who
has been as ill as you have been. You
would not like to sink down through the
floor any more, would you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you think you’re just a little bit of a
humbug?” said Piers, gazing full into Mrs.
Tarbot’s face. “Why do you talk in that way,
just as if you had made it up, and why do you
turn your eyes away? I don’t think mother
can have gone away, and I’m sure Dick and
Barbara must be here, because——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it likely I’d tell you a lie, Piers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, of course I hope you wouldn’t, but
I’m not sure. I suppose you wouldn’t, that is,
if you are a good woman. Are you a good
woman, nurse?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, child, no. Heaven help me, no, I’m
not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then perhaps you do tell lies. Of course,
good women never do. God hates those who
tell them, so you had better be careful. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>never tell lies, and that’s why I keep my promise
to you. I never tell grannie my secret.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you had done so, Piers, you would have
been an awfully wicked little boy. You must
never, never tell Mrs. Ives the truth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t, because I promised, but why do
you call her Mrs. Ives? She’s your mother—you
<em>do</em> forget your fifth commandment.
Well, now I’ll tell you something she says.
Every morning the first thing when she gets
up she says, ‘Piers, blood is thicker than
water; but, Piers,’ she goes on, ‘there is some
as has water in their veins instead of blood.’
I don’t know what she means by that, nurse,
unless she’s talking about you; but you haven’t
water in your veins instead of blood, have
you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, dear, my mother could not have meant
me. She’s an old woman, and she’s given to
talking nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There you are, forgetting your fifth commandment
again. I tell you I like her very
much. She’s not quite as handsome as you,
but I think perhaps she’s a better woman than
you are. She never tells a lie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Piers, you are talking nonsense, and I am
angry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Angry?” said the child.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, because you talk nonsense. You
ought to be satisfied and to trust me. Your
own mother and your Cousin Dick and your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>friend Barbara are far away. Some day, if you
are really good, you will see them again, that
is, if you trust me; if not——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If not?” queried the child.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then, Piers, I shall have to take you away
from my mother, and put you with some one
else, who will be stern and who won’t listen to
any nonsense you may talk. I don’t wish to
threaten you, dear little man, for I love you,
but I shall have to do it if you go on as you
are doing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I have been brave,” said the boy, his
brown eyes filling with tears. He clasped his
hands and looked straight before him. “I
have never told,” he continued. “Each morning
when I wake I ask God to help me to keep
my secret and not to let me tell a lie. All during
the day it’s on the tip of my tongue to say,
‘I’m Sir Piers Pelham, and my mother lives
at No. 12 Ashley Mansions, and my Cousin
Dick, his other name is Pelham, and my friend
Barbara, her other name is Evershed.’ It’s
always and always on the tip of my tongue.
But I don’t say any of these things because I
promised you I wouldn’t. Oh, it’s hard of you
to say that you are angry with me. I am a
brave boy, and I wouldn’t tell a lie for the
world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re a perfect darling,” said Clara, overcome
by the beauty of the child and the magic
of his words. She lifted him out of bed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>held him in her arms, cuddling him close to
her, until at last he fell asleep with his head
on her breast.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would almost die for him,” she thought.
“Some day he shall come into his own again;
but not yet—not at present. I have Luke to
think of. I have almost given up hope of
winning Luke’s heart, but I may succeed yet.
If so, little Piers, you must keep your secret
for a long, long time.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <span class='large'>“YOUR EYES ARE BIG AND BRIGHT.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When the boy was sound asleep Clara went
into the room where her mother was waiting
for her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Clary, and how do you think he is?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Splendid, mother. You have taken excellent
care of him, but you must go back with
him to Cornwall to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He don’t like it; he’s mad to come back
to his own folk. Why should he stay away
from them?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he goes back you’ll lose your two
pounds a week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye, there’s summat in that,” said the old
woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I love my bit of money,” she continued
after a pause. “I don’t believe in no bankses.
I has my money in an old stocking at the back
of the chimney. I has got a hundred and fifty
pounds. When are we to go back, Clary?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the first train to-morrow. It is sheer
madness of you to stay here. If you do such
a thing again I must take the boy away and put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>him in the care of some one else, but I would
rather he were with you, mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may as well leave him with me. I’ll
look after him and tend him, and he loves
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, mother, here’s five pounds over and
above what I generally give. This will be
plenty for your fare and the boy’s back to
Cornwall, and I will send you three pounds a
week in the future if you will look after him
well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Three pounds a week?” said the old
woman. “That’s twelve pounds a month—a
deal of money—a deal! I’ll look after him a
bit longer then, Clary, but don’t try me too
much, for I can’t abear his little cry of ‘I’ve a
secret, but you mustn’t guess; and if you knew
who my people were you’d take me home,
wouldn’t you, grannie?’ That’s his little cry,
and he’s such a grand, brave little chap. I
don’t know what you’re after, but it’s evil, I
make no doubt. You ain’t my sort—you don’t
go to your chapel reg’lar, and you don’t say
your prayers reg’lar. And duck green is your
complexion, and your freckles is spreading.
Now I’ll say good night, for if you ain’t tired
I am.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives held up her mouth as she spoke
to Clara’s sallow cheek. The daughter scarcely
returned her salutation. Wrapped in thought
she left the house. She ran down-stairs and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>let herself out, returning to the house in Harley
Street some time after one o’clock. As she
stood on the steps fumbling for her latch-key,
her husband confronted her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where have you been?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To see an old patient.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought you had given up nursing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had a message from an old patient who
wished particularly to see me—a message which
I could not refuse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your mother brought it to you, didn’t
she?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did you know my mother was here,
Luke?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I saw you go out with her. What did she
come about?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have just told you she brought a message
from a patient, Luke. I did not know you
were curious.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not the least curious,” he replied.
“To be curious signifies an interest in a person.
As I do not take the slightest interest in
you I am not curious. Now, I have much to
do, and will wish you good night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good night,” she answered. Husband and
wife parted in the hall. Clara went very slowly
up the broad flight of stairs. When she reached
the first landing she turned and looked back
at Tarbot, he on his part looking up at her.
The look she gave him back in return was full
of an undefined and curious expression. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>puzzled the man, and he thought it over a good
bit as he sat in his study.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I did not know that it was quite impossible,”
he said to himself, “I should say
that my wife, the woman to whom I have
given my name, for whom I have ruined myself,
holds some secret against me. What did
she mean when she spoke of having the ace of
trumps in her hand? If Clara turns against
me I shall be lost. I hate her, but I must keep
friendly with her, that’s evident. She would
be faithful to me—poor soul!—if she thought
I had the least vestige of love for her. Can I
feign what she wants and so get that ace of
trumps from her? Shall I try?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He sat with his head buried in his hands for
some time, but as the night advanced he paced
the room restlessly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara also scarcely slept that night. Early
in the morning she rose and went to her husband.
He was still in his study.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara was dressed with care, and notwithstanding
her sleepless night looked trim and
fresh. As usual, she wore black; soft real
lace encircled her thin white throat, and her
head, with its crown of red hair, looked something
like a tropical flower. She was a graceful
woman, and the dress she now wore gave
her a special charm.</p>

<p class='c010'>To Tarbot, who had been experimenting,
analyzing, thinking hard, who was almost worn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>out in consequence, she suddenly appeared as
almost a vision of beauty.</p>

<p class='c010'>He looked up as she entered, carrying a
little tray. It contained tea and toast. With
a flash of quick thought he remembered afresh
her expression of the night before—that she
held the ace of trumps in her hand. He knew
that if he could give her any affection she
would be his forever. At that moment, with
this thought in his head, she was almost attractive
to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You should not stay up all night,” she
said. “I have brought you this. Sit down
and let me pour you out a cup of tea.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He sank into the nearest chair. She poured
out the tea, putting in the amount of sugar and
cream that he liked. She brought the fragrant
cup to his side, and buttering a piece of toast,
put it on a plate and laid it on a little table
near by. As he lifted the cup to his lips his
eyes fixed themselves on her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are an extraordinary woman,” he
began. “When I think of you as——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As what, Luke?” she asked eagerly, for
there seemed to her at that moment to be a
new note in his voice. If, after all, he was beginning
to love her, if by any chance that
passion which she felt for him was about to be
responded to, then good-by to all else, good-by
to the child’s future, good-by to everything
but the prize which she had set herself to win.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>To win Luke Tarbot’s heart she would not care
to what crime she stooped. Now she came a
little nearer to him, and laid one of her thin
but shapely hands on his arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very tired, and you ought to rest,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am tired,” he replied, “dead tired, worn
out. A night like this takes a lot out of a man.
Clara, you look well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad you think so. I have put on no
jewels because you dislike them. I take great
pains with my dress these days.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You do, my poor girl.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For your sake, Luke.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is useless, Clara,” he said, but he uttered
the words sadly, and still there was that new
puzzled expression in his eyes, and, notwithstanding
his words, she did not think that her
pains were quite thrown away.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having finished his tea, Tarbot was refreshed.
He stood up. He did not mind talking to
Clara in the garish morning light.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall be an old man before my time,” he
said abruptly. “I am a disappointed, a bitterly
disappointed man. I only live for one thing now.
When that is over my career will be ended.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara made no reply, but her gray eyes
were still fixed upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And until it is over I shall have no rest,”
he continued. “There is a fever here.” He
laid his hand against his heart.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“If you will go to your room you can have
two or three hours of perfect quiet,” said
Clara. “Lay your head on your pillow, and
you will drop asleep immediately.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I could take your advice, but I am
the victim of insomnia; it has only come
on lately. I did not like to tell you of it. I
would give the world at this present moment
for a couple of hours’ refreshing slumber.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me make some passes across your forehead—I
know exactly how. You will soon
sleep if I do so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean that you want to mesmerize
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not exactly to mesmerize you, Luke—not
to go as far as that. It would require a
stronger woman than I am to mesmerize a man
like you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He smiled at her—his slow, inscrutable
smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I can put you to sleep. Let me try.
Just stay quiet, and don’t resist me. Let
yourself go. In ten minutes you will be
asleep.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you limit the duration of my sleep?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, you shall sleep for an hour, two hours,
three hours. How long can you give yourself?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What o’clock is it now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Six o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“I can sleep until nine, I believe. Will
you promise to wake me at nine o’clock?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You shall wake yourself. I need not be
present. I will simply suggest to you that you
sleep for three hours, and at nine you will
wake. You may rest assured that things will
happen exactly as I wish.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where did you learn all this gibberish,
Clara? Oh, of course, with Dr. Weismann in
Paris. He was a rare humbug.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You would not think so if you had been in
his employment, as I was for three years. He
performed marvelous cures, and was a wonderful
man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is dead, is he not?” said Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is. Had he been alive I should still
have been with him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye, Clara, and happier than with me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps so, Luke; but all the same, I am
with you, and I would not change my lot for
that of any other woman in the world. It is
within your power to——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To do what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To make me the happiest woman on earth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know how.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I know how,” he said half sleepily,
for already she was looking into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have done much for you, after all, Clara,”
he said. “It is not every man who would
marry a woman like you. You were a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>plain woman before I gave you the means to
dress yourself properly. You are not exactly
plain now. You remind me of a beautiful snake—your
head, as you arrange your hair lately,
looks brilliant, but at any moment you may
stretch out a forked tongue and strike, strike
death—you give that impression. It is not a
pleasant one, and yet to a certain extent it
fascinates. You have a power of your own,
and on many men you can exercise it, but not
on me. I have done much for you. What
more do you want? I have given you house,
name, position, unlimited wealth—what more
do you want?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want more—a little thing, but of such
priceless value!” she said hungrily.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was lying back looking up at her. She
was making passes across his forehead.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I feel strangely sleepy,” he said. “The
most delicious sleep steals over me. It is
wonderful! You are a queer creature. What
more did you say you wanted—what is the
thing of priceless value?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A heart, Luke—yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot gave a laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My heart!” he cried. “It is out of your
reach—high as the heavens it is above you,
or low as hell beneath you, whichever simile
you like best. It can never be yours. Did
you say I should wake in three hours?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In three hours,” she answered quietly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“Don’t turn your eyes from me—keep looking
at me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your eyes are big and bright—wonderfully
bright. There is a flash of sea-green in them.
Now, Barbara’s eyes are brown with golden
lights—yours are green and icy cold. How
sleepy I feel. No, you will never have my
heart—but folly! I won’t give way to this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The next instant his eyes closed, and he was
in a sound and childlike slumber.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara looked at him with a grim smile on
her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe I shall win him yet,” she murmured.
“If so, beware, little Piers Pelham!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>WITH THE DOCTORS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Barbara received Mrs. Tarbot’s letter by
the first post in the morning. She read the
contents and determined to act on Clara’s
counsel at once. Pelham was just getting up
when his wife appeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear, how bad you look!” said Barbara,
giving him a glance of mingled apprehension
and affection.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Matters get worse and worse with me,
Bab,” he replied. “I sometimes scarcely
know what I am doing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is all nerves, dear,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If so, do you know a cure?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Common sense,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean, Barbara?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What I say. You are very anxious. If
your mind were set at rest your nervous fears
would vanish.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, but that’s just it. I can’t set my mind
at rest. You don’t know what happened last
night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He then related his interview with Mrs. Pelham
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>and his further interview with Tarbot.
Barbara listened attentively.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know what I would do,” she said suddenly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are not satisfied with the death certificate?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You suspect Dr. Tarbot?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Heaven help me, Barbara, I do. I cannot
help it. The man is a scoundrel. I cannot
look at him without being assured on that
point.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t like him,” said Barbara; “but
never, no, never for a single moment, can I
think of him as you do. The dear little fellow
came by his death through natural causes—of
that I am firmly convinced, but if I were you,
Dick——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would go and see the two great consultants
who were called in when little Piers was
so ill.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham gazed at her anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is a capital idea,” he said, and his
brow cleared.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will act on it, Dick—will you not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will think about it,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The two great consultants,” she called
after him, as he left the room. “You’ll visit
them both. Ask them if their verdict coincides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>with that of Luke Tarbot, and then go to the
chemist, Dick, and get a copy of the prescription
for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good, good!” he answered. “You’re a
wife in a thousand, Bab.” He kissed her
affectionately.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham felt too much excited to eat any
breakfast. He went into the Park and wandered
about until it was late enough to visit
Sir Richard Spears. When at ten o’clock he
presented himself at the house of the great
specialist his eyes were gleaming brightly, but
the rest of his face looked haggard. He asked
if the doctor was in. The servant replied in
the affirmative. Pelham then inquired if he
might see him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you an appointment, sir?” asked
the man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; but, all the same, it is most urgent
that I should see him as soon as possible.”
As Pelham spoke he produced his card. The
man looked at it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will inquire if the doctor can see you, sir.
You are early, and it maybe possible that he
can give you an interview before his other
patients arrive.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man took Pelham’s card into the doctor’s
inner sanctum. He soon reappeared and
motioned Pelham to follow him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sir Richard Spears had keen eyes. As
patient after patient appeared before him he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>was wont to give each a quick glance, after
which he scarcely troubled to watch their
faces again. In that glance, as a rule, he
found out what was the matter with each of
those who came to ask him for relief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A highly disordered nervous condition,”
was his comment with regard to Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sit down. What can I do for you?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can answer a question,” said Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“About yourself? You come to me as a
patient?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In one sense, yes, in another, no. I
am very much troubled, and I think it just
possible that you may be able to relieve
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then yours is a mental case, but——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have come to ask you a question,” interrupted
Pelham, “and I am willing to pay the
ordinary fee. Will you answer it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ask it and then I will tell you,” said the
doctor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My question is this: You saw little Sir
Piers Pelham during his last illness. You saw
him, I am given to understand, in consultation
with Dr. Tarbot of Harley Street?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is so; but this, Sir Richard Pelham”—the
doctor glanced at the young man’s card
as he spoke—“this is unusual.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is unusual, and so is my attitude,” replied
Pelham. “What I have come to ask is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>this: Do you believe that the child’s death
was owing to aortic disease?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Undoubtedly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham’s brow cleared. He gave a short,
quick sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you ask me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because I have had my doubts. I have
known Piers from a child: he never showed
the slightest symptom of heart disease.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That fact has nothing to do with it. Aortic
disease may come on suddenly and—end
abruptly. In the case of your young friend it
did so. I am glad to be able to relieve your
mind. Yours is a somewhat strange inquiry,
but I have thought it best to answer it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is your fee?” asked Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing, because I have done nothing for
you. Good-by. By the way, you don’t look
too well yourself. You ought to have change
and rest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall be better now,” replied Pelham.
He left the house. From Sir Richard Spears
he went to Dr. Williamson. He was also fortunate
enough to see him, and to put to him
the same question. The same reply was
vouchsafed. The boy had died from aortic
disease. Aortic disease as a rule ended suddenly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dick’s relief was now so manifest in his face
that he could almost laugh aloud. From Dr.
Williamson he went straight to the chemist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>from whom he had obtained the medicine
which had been given to little Sir Piers on the
night of his death. The chemist was willing
to give him a copy of the prescription. Dick
knew nothing whatever about medicine, but
having got the copy, he asked the man what
each ingredient meant. In some surprise the
chemist answered him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is a very harmless prescription,” he
said. “It would have little effect one way or
the other.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the child for whom it was meant,” said
Dick, his suspicions returning in a flash, “required
a strong stimulant immediately.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The chemist shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not prepared to enter into that question,”
he answered. “This prescription is
harmless—a little sal volatile, a small dose of
digitalis, etc., etc.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you,” replied Dick.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am a fool for my pains,” he said to himself.
“Tarbot is an honest man, and the child died
from natural causes. I am a fool for my pains.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He rushed home and burst into the room
where Barbara was sitting. His face was now
like sunshine.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will have no cause to be miserable
again,” he said. “I have taken your advice.
My suspicions have vanished into thin air.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank God for His mercy!” said the
young wife.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE LITTLE WOMAN IN BLACK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>About a fortnight after the Pelhams had
taken up their residence at Pelham Towers a
little old woman might have been seen making
her way slowly up the avenue. From the
lodge gates to the mansion was a distance of
nearly two miles. The little woman as she
walked kept muttering to herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Craft shall meet craft,” she was saying.
“Yes, if Clary had confided in me I wouldn’t
ha’ done nothing secret or unbeknown, but as
it is, I’ll just find out for myself what I can.
The child’s as good a little lad as ever walked
the earth. He’s all the same to me as if he
were bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh.
There’s nothing I wouldn’t do for him. But
a dearie me! I ain’t a-going to be gulled not
for nobody, and by Clary least of all. Haven’t
I nursed her and dangled her in my arms and
lay awake with her when she was teething, and
is she going to make a fool of her old mother
now? Not a bit of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s a mighty secret wrapped up in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>that little lad, and I’m going to get to the bottom
of it. He never told me—poor darling!—but
Clary didn’t count that he’d talk in his
sleep. She gives me three pound a week for
looking after him; s’pose I make her give me
ten or fifteen, or s’pose I tell her that her secret
and I ain’t going to be bedfellows much longer.
S’pose I refuse to keep it altogether? Ah, I
have Clary in my power. Fancy me having a
woman like that under my thumb! But it is
so—it is so. When she was young she was
always one too many for me. Even as a little
tot she would have her own way, and she’d look
round at me as spiteful as you please, and just
do the very thing I told her not, but the tables
is going to be turned now, or I’m much mistook.
I wish no ill to my own darter, but I’ll
know her secret or my name’s not Sary
Ives.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The little woman walked on as rapidly as
she could. She was a smart little personage
and very trim and spruce for her years. It
was a windy day, and her thin skirts were blown
about her spare figure. She wore an old-fashioned
poke bonnet, and a black shawl was
pinned neatly across her chest. She looked
the very essence of rustic respectability. Her
dress was of black merino, and she had a gay
crimson kerchief peeping out under the shawl;
her gloves were of crimson cloth of the same
color as the kerchief. She wore cloth boots
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>with elastic sides, and looked down at them
now and then with complacency.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye, I’m as neat as a new pin,” she said to
herself; “and these boots are as comfortable
as can be. Yes, I’ll find out all I can, and I’ll
let out nothing. Now, I wonder who this
pretty young miss is a-coming up the avenue.
I’ll bob a curtsey to her leastways.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A tall girl leading a bicycle and wearing a
dark blue serge cycling dress was seen approaching.
A couple of dogs were following
her. The dogs made at once for the old
woman, barking loudly as they did so. But
Mrs. Ives was no coward. She dropped two
or three curtseys, as was her manner, first to
the lady and then to the dogs. The dogs began
to leap up at her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Manners, manners!” she cried to them.
“Get down. Call ’em off, please, missy, call
’em off. I ain’t afeared, for I don’t think
they’ll bite, but I don’t want to be stretched
flat on the road. Call ’em off, please,
missy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara whistled to the dogs, who immediately
bounded back to her. She drew up
before the little woman, who dropped another
curtsey.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eh, but you’re a pretty gel, and it’s a
pleasure to look at you,” said Mrs. Ives.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara colored.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know your face,” she said. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>know most of the people round here. Are
you a stranger?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dearie, that I am, and my name is Ives—Mrs.
Ives—at your service.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ives!” said Barbara, feeling puzzled.
“Ives—it is an uncommon name,” she added.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, my love, but not so uncommon in
Cornwall as here. I hail from Cornwall,
missy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have never been in Cornwall,” said Barbara,
“but I understand that it is a beautiful
county.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That it is. Eh, but you won’t mind a
compliment from an old woman—you have a
sweet face. I like them big brown eyes and
that clear sort of complexion without any
freckles. Was you ever troubled with freckles,
dear?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” replied Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, there’s a beautiful recipe I has got
for getting rid of ’em. It’s mostly made of
buttermilk, but the buttermilk must be fresh.
Oh, I beg your pardon, Miss”—for Barbara
was beginning to move on. “I was on my
way to the house to see the lady, the new lady
what has got lately married—Lady Pelham.
I want to ask her some questions.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am Lady Pelham,” said Barbara, “so you
need not go to the house to see me. Can I
do anything for you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, sakes alive!” Mrs. Ives dropped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>three or four curtseys in quick succession.
“To think that I should be looking at a real
titled dame! It must be wonderful comfortin’
to be called Lady. Do you like it, my dear
young Miss?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” answered Barbara, who began to be
much entertained. “I like to be called Lady
Pelham because I know then that I am my
dear husband’s wife. I love him with all my
heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s right, and as it should be,” said old
Mrs. Ives in an emphatic voice. “I like to
hear a young lady stand up for her good man.
And how long is you wedded, dear?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not long—not quite two months.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye, these are early days. You haven’t
had your first quarrel, has you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; why should I ever have a quarrel?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, they come in the best intentioned
families—they’re certain to come. You’ll fret,
and you’ll fume, and you’ll say ’ard things to
one another, and you’ll get a little away from
each other, but if you’re a sensible miss, as I
take you to be by that glint in your eyes, you’ll
come together again. Things will be all right
if you’ll only use common sense and bear and
forbear. That’s it, my dear young lady. Bear
and forbear. That’s what I’d like to say to
my darter, who’s lately married, but she
wouldn’t hear it from me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And why should she not hear it from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>you, for it is excellent advice?” said Barbara.
“But you say you’re a stranger to these
parts.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I come from the next county, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you want to say something to me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought I’d call in, for I’m sort of curious.
Seems to me as I know your name.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I daresay you have heard it before. The
Pelhams of Pelham Towers are well known.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In their own county, no doubt,” said the
old woman, “but not in mine, at least, not
among the cottagers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you have heard the name?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye, and that’s my secret.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You look rather fagged with your walk.
You must come down to the house with me
and have something to eat. You don’t look
too strong.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I am, my dear; I’m as strong as can
be. I’ll be seventy my next birthday. Come
November I’ll have done my three score years
and ten, but dear heart, there ain’t no failing
about me. I’m a bit withered—ripe, I tells
the child.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you have a child. Is he your own?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not he. He’s a little lad what lives with
me. I call ’im my own child, for I’m fond of
him. Yes, I’ll come to the house with you if
you like. I’d be glad of a bite and a sup.
Beer is what I takes. I can’t abear tea—it’s
washy stuff.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“You shall have a glass of beer and some
cold meat. Come this way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you was going for a ride on that
wicked-looking machine,” said the old woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, the ride can keep,” returned Barbara.
“I’ll come with you and make you comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As she spoke she turned her bicycle and
walked down the long avenue by the little
woman’s side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is a powerful big place,” said Mrs.
Ives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is,” answered Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your husband must be a rich man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is, very.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, I wonder has you any other places
to call your own?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe we have several.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear heart! it seems too much for a
young couple. You’ll be wore out with the
responsibility of ’em, my deary. You’d ha’
done a deal better to pray the prayer of Agar
and be satisfied with what he asked the Almighty
for.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t remember what he wanted at this
moment,” replied Barbara with a smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my word! you ain’t been brought up
proper on your Bible. ‘Give me neither
poverty nor riches,’ was Agar’s cry, ‘and feed
me with food convenient for me.’ I often
thought how beautiful was his words, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>when I sees the rich and great of the earth I
says to mysel’, ‘Well, they’re not Agars.’
They might ha’ been Agars if they liked and
gave away some of their property to feed the
starving, but they didn’t like it and they ain’t
got the blessing. My deary, I’d like well to
see that husband of yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If we meet him I’ll introduce him to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s his name, dear?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir Richard Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye, that’s a pretty name; and you’re not
married more than two months?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you’ll be happy, Lady Pelham, and
you has my best wishes. Oh, is this the
house?”</p>

<p class='c010'>They were turning a corner of the avenue
as the old woman spoke, and now the magnificent
old pile, gray with age, appeared in
view. Mrs. Ives dropped a succession of curtseys
with great rapidity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s my way of expressing my feelings,”
she said, looking at Barbara. “It’s a magnificent
place, and you must be proud of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not at all. Sometimes one feels both
pleasure and pain in possessing a place of this
sort.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, that’s because you’re young to it,”
said Mrs. Ives. “You’ll soon get accustomed,
mark my words. Of course, only being
wedded two months, you naturally feel a bit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>strange. Perhaps afore you was married you
was a poor girl like my Clary.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Clara!” cried Barbara in astonishment.
“Clara Ives! Do you mean to tell me,” she
cried excitedly, “that you are the mother of
Clara Ives, the nurse?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Same, love, same. She’s my own true
darter—a plain girl.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And she’s married to Dr. Tarbot?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, my dear; like yourself, she’s married
riches—from poverty she has come to great
wealth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was never exactly poor in that way,” said
Barbara, who did not care to have her past
compared to that of Clara Ives. “But this is
interesting!” she cried. “You are not like
Mrs. Tarbot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, something the same, my dear. I’ve
just them sort of crabbed notions; she was
always a crabbed girl, but mortal clever.
Well, I was curious to see the place and now
I’ve seen it, and I’m pleased to have had this
talk with you. Now, your husband, he don’t
have your feelings, do he? He’s accustomed
to wealth from his birth, ain’t that so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, no, that’s the curious part,” said Barbara,
who found herself confiding in this old
woman, and not in the least minding the fact
that she was doing so. “Dick, my dear
husband, came in for the property unexpectedly.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>“Indeed, that do sound romantic. Was it a
sudden death, a shipwreck, or a murder, that
done it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no, no, nothing like that—but it was
very sad. Mr. Pelham, as he was then, was
very poor, and he loved me well, but we could
not marry. Then his dear little cousin died—such
a sweet boy—and Dick became Sir
Richard Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, quite a little child it was who stood in
the way and he died?” said Mrs. Ives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” replied Barbara, “the little boy
died.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A baby were he, love?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no, not a baby. He was seven years
old—such a pretty boy!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To be sure now, that was great trouble.
And so your husband came in for the property
then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How long ago, may I ask?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Two or three months ago. It all happened
unexpectedly. The boy was never strong—he
died of heart disease. By the way,” continued
Barbara, looking full at the old woman, “you
must have heard about it, for your daughter
nursed him during his last illness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A mercy me!” said Mrs. Ives. “As if
that makes any difference! Clary talk about
her patients to her old mother! Not she. I
knows nothing about it, dear, and I’d like well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>to hear the story. But your eyes are full of
tears; you look quite sad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I always feel sad when I think of him—dear
little Piers!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To be sure, to be sure. What was it you
called him, love?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Piers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s an uncommon name.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is, but it has belonged to the family of
the Pelhams for generations. I am sorry Dick
is not Piers, although, of course, I like his own
name.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am vastly interested by what you tells
me, love. The child must have been a nice
little gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; but I can’t talk of him any more.
It makes me too sad. Come this way, Mrs.
Ives.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara entered the house and took the old
woman in the direction of the housekeeper’s
room. The housekeeper’s name was Mrs. Posset.
She was very stout, and she always wore
the richest of black silk dresses and the finest
of real lace caps. When Barbara entered she
rose and looked with anything but approval at
Mrs. Ives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Please, Mrs. Posset,” said Barbara in her
kind voice, “will you give this old lady something
to eat? She is tired and has come a
long way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eh, <em>dear</em>, what a beautiful dress!” cried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Mrs. Ives, dropping a low curtsey to the housekeeper,
who was much more stately in her
manner than Barbara herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>A little flattery always mollified Mrs. Posset,
and she told Barbara that she would do what
was necessary. Accordingly she invited Mrs.
Ives to seat herself, and ringing a bell, the
still-room maid appeared. Directions were
given to her, with the result that in about five
minutes a trayful of appetizing viands was
brought into the room. The tray was placed
in front of Mrs. Ives, who drew off her crimson
gloves, unfastened her black shawl, and
prepared to enjoy herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eh,” she said, looking up at Mrs. Posset
presently, “it’s a mournful tale.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?” asked the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That about the little lad who died.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d rather not talk of it,” said Mrs. Posset.
As she spoke her face began to work—it got
crimson, then her eyes filled with tears. She
covered her face and sobbed audibly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She do take it to heart. I can pump her
a bit,” thought the old woman. After a moment
she said—</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re upset, ma’am, and I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am,” said Mrs. Posset. “I loved him as
if he were my own. He was a dear little chap.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He must have been, and the young lady
what got her husband and the beautiful place,
too, by means of the death, seems mighty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>troubled, too. I s’pose he was a handsome
little feller?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Handsome!” cried Mrs. Posset. “I never
saw his like, never. The most beautiful child
you ever set eyes on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fair, I s’pose? Most of the quality is fair.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a bit of it. Dark as a raven, black hair,
beautiful brown eyes, and such a complexion.
And the manner with him and the loving
words, and the way he’d fling his arms round
my neck and say, ‘I love you, Posset. Posset,
have you got a bit of cake for me?’ Oh,
he was a darling little chap!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He must have been,” said Mrs. Ives. “It’s
afflictin’ to hear you, ma’am. Maybe you has
got his picter? I’d like well to see it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have got a lovely photograph, but I don’t
show it to everybody.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, then, ma’am, I won’t ask again, and
I’m very much obliged for the nice food and
thank you kindly. I sympathize with your
grief. I has lost children of my own, and I
know what it means.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you would really like to see the photograph,”
began Mrs. Posset, “I don’t mind showing
it to you, for you seem a feeling sort of
body.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As she spoke she crossed the room, opened
a chiffonier and took out a leather case. This
she unfastened and laid before the little woman.
Mrs. Ives dropped three or four curtseys in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>succession, her face turned white and her lips
trembled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thank you, ma’am. It brings the tears
to my eyes to see that little face,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then she made a hasty adieu and vanished.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>On leaving the house Mrs. Ives walked
quickly up the avenue. When she had gone
nearly a mile she met one of the under-gardeners.
He was weeding and cutting the edges of
the road. As her wont was, Mrs. Ives dropped
a curtsey right in front of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A’ternoon,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man looked at her and nodded in reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fine day,” he said after a pause.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, fine day,” said Mrs. Ives, “but you
might speak to a body. In Cornwall they
speaks to a body when a body curtseys. Isn’t
that the manner with Devonshire folk?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t mean to be oncivil,” said the man.
“Was there anything you wanted to ask,
ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d be obliged if you’d kindly direct me to
the family vault,” said Mrs. Ives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What in the name of fortune for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Curiosity, my young lad. If I has a failing
it’s unbounded curiosity. I want to see the
place where the little Sir Piers is lying till the
trump of doom.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“Oh, if you really wish to see the family
vault,” said the man resting on his spade as
he spoke, “you just take that turn there to
the left and you’ll find yourself alongside the
chapel. There’s a lych gate and a graveyard
all correct and proper. You go through the
gate and you’ll see the vault in front of you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A big vault, I s’pose?” said Mrs. Ives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, a big square vault with a stone top.
It’s mostly full by now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t want to hear no more,” said Mrs.
Ives. “I am curious by natur’, but I has no
taste for the horrors. I’ll be wishing you a
good a’ternoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She dropped another curtsey, and the man
touched his hat and went on with his work.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives took the next turning to her left.
She went down a narrow path, and presently
saw where the old chapel, partly in ruins and
partly well preserved, came into view. In the
east portion of the chapel services could be
held, and were held on certain occasions. The
old lych gate was in front of her. She opened
it and went through, and then walked up the
path which led to the chapel. The chapel itself
was open and she entered. The walls of
that part which were still in preservation were
covered with brasses and monuments, some
very old fashioned, some more modern, but all
erected to the praise and glory of the dead and
gone Pelhams. In every direction there were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>monuments, and as she was looking some
workmen were busy. They saw her and made
way for her to pass. A lovely tablet of the
purest white marble was being put up to the
memory of little Piers. Mrs. Ives began to
speak to the men, but they were strangers and
did not know anything about the child.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems mortal sad for the young to pass
away in their first blush,” said Mrs. Ives, turning
to the head workman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is that, ma’am,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And where is this beautiful monument to
be placed, if I may venture to ask?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“On this wall, in front of the family pew,
just there,” said the man. “It’s young Lady
Pelham has ordered it to be done. She comes
to see how we are getting on every day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it’s a pretty simple design, and no
doubt worthy of the lamb called so early to his
rest,” said Mrs. Ives. She dropped another
curtsey, not to the man but to the tablet, and
went into the churchyard. There she found
the family vault and stood by it for a time. An
old man who was passing through the graveyard
came up to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now I wonder was you present at the
funeral of Sir Piers Pelham?” asked Mrs. Ives,
dropping two curtseys.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, that I were,” he replied, “and it was
the finest funeral we’ve had for many a day.
All the county come, and there was a lot of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>crying and sobbing, but it was nothing to what
took place that same night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What were that?” she asked. “I like a
good story,” she continued. She slipped her
hand into her pocket, produced a shilling, and
pressed it into the man’s palm. He pocketed
it with a quick motion and turned and faced
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t mind telling what I know,” he said.
“The awful time was when the heir himself,
the new baronet, come back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir Richard, you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The same. He come that night all alone,
and he were in a terrible state. He went right
into the vault. He had a lantern with him,
and down he went, yes down the steps and
into the vault. I stood near in the dark trembling
mighty, just ahint that yew tree, but he
didn’t notice me. He went into the vault, and
I saw the lantern lighting up the gloom. I
heard him groaning to himself. He was in
mortal trouble if ever young man were.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a strange tale,” said Mrs. Ives, “and
afflictin’. He must ha’ been a tender-hearted
young man. I’ll wish you a good a’ternoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She left the little churchyard and was soon
on the high road. She reached Haversham
station in time to catch her train, and very late
the same night found herself home once more
in her little cottage in Cornwall.</p>

<p class='c010'>Piers was asleep. As he lay on his small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>bed, with one arm flung above his clustering
mass of black curls, Mrs. Ives shading a candle,
bent carefully over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The same,” she muttered. “The same
shape of face, the true oval, most aristocratic,
the mouth with its dimples and its curves—aye,
it takes quality to make a mouth like that.
The brows—I could be romantic over the
brows, they look as if they was Cupid’s bows.
I ha’ heard the expression, it’s poetry and it’s
beautiful. The ’air dark and curly and as soft
as silk. Oh, he’s the very same. Clary, what
do it mean? what do it mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The little woman left the boy and went back
to her kitchen. There she sat with her hands
folded on her lap and a look of consternation,
even terror, on her small crabbed face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do it mean?” she repeated. “There’s
no doubt they ha’ put a coffin in the vault, but
there ain’t no little Sir Piers in it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives’ thoughts were so disturbing that,
weary as she was, she did not care to go to bed.
She drew a glass of beer from a barrel in the
corner, drank it off, and after a very long time
lay down without troubling to undress in the
room where the boy slept.</p>

<p class='c010'>Early in the morning he awoke fresh and
bright. He scrambled out of bed and went
to the old woman’s side. He then sat on the
bottom of the bed and faced her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ve come back,” he said. “I’m so glad.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>“I have come back, Piers,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where were you yesterday, grannie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I went on a long journey into Devonshire.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh,” said Piers very solemnly, “I wish you
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why so, love? Do you object to me
going into the next county?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do,” replied Piers, “because——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I can’t tell you. She’ll be angry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who, dear?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you mean my darter—Mrs. Tarbot?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do, grannie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, whether she’s angry or whether she’s
not,” said Mrs. Ives, “I went sure enough.
You sit there on the bed and I’ll tell you a bit
of a story. I went to a beautiful place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you?” said the boy. He was trembling
and the color was coming and going in
his face. One moment his cheeks were brilliantly
red, the next white. His little hands
shook, he locked one inside the other to keep
them still.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A real beautiful place,” continued Mrs.
Ives. “I won’t name no names, for names is
worriting to the young, but I went there and
saw a very lovely young lady.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A lovely young lady,” repeated little Piers.
“I like lovely ladies. Was she more beautiful
than your daughter, grannie?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>“My darter and she ain’t in the same runnin’.
You know how freckled my poor Clary
is, but there weren’t a freckle on her face, bless
her, and her eyes were as brown as hazel nuts
and wide open, and with a sparkle in the middle
of ’em.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I once knew eyes like that,” said little Piers.
“Please don’t say any more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not, love? It was a beautiful place,
and she was good to me, and took me down
to the house. Oh, there was a mortal long
avenue—two miles, if you’ll believe me, Piers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Two miles!” said little Piers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the matter, dear?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing, but your story makes me sad. I
once knew an avenue two miles long.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No! did you, love? That’s curious, very.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did,” said little Piers. “You may go on
talking if you like, grannie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m glad you’re interested, my hearty, and
I’m willing to go on. The young lady with
the pretty brown eyes took me down to the
house and I was took to the housekeeper’s room.
Dear heart! the housekeeper was mortal stout.
I don’t believe she’s long for this world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Little Piers got crimson.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She is,” he cried, “she is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She’s not, love. She’s too stout to live.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She’s not a bit too stout,” said little Piers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you say that, dear? You don’t
know her, do you?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“I won’t say whether I know her or not,”
returned the boy firmly, “but she’s not too
stout. She’s a darling. I love her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the matter with you, Piers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t like that story. It reminds me
of——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of what, love?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My secret. Please don’t tell me any more,
grannie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t if it frets you, dear heart. Go and
put on your things, and we’ll both have our
breakfast. You must be very hungry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I seem to lose hunger when you talk
about the house, and the housekeeper, and the
brown eyes of that beautiful, most beautiful
girl.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I won’t say another word. Oh, by
the way, they was all in sorrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Were they? What about?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems there was a little chap that—but
what is the matter, Piers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t listen, I won’t, I won’t,” cried Piers.
He clapped his hands to his ears and rushed
out of the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He shall come into his own. There’s a
cruel sin somewhere, and Clary is at the bottom
of it,” said Mrs. Ives to herself.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>NOT IN THE BARGAIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Nearly a month went by and the time was
getting towards Christmas. The weather in
London was bitterly cold. Fogs were frequent,
and there was a good deal of sickness
about.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham had left town and gone down
to Pelham Towers to stay with the new owner
and his wife. She was to spend Christmas
with them. Tarbot had discovered what he
considered a specific against influenza and was
specially busy. His wife helped him. She
had thrown herself into the full interest of his
work, and was a valuable assistant. He found
himself talking over his cases with her. She
gave him many an important suggestion.</p>

<p class='c010'>As a competent nurse and even as a friend
he began to find her not disagreeable. Her
hopes were high that she might yet win that
shriveled and undeveloped part of him which
he called his heart. As illness increased and
the doctor’s time became more and more busy,
Clara hoped against hope that his darling revenge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>was being put out of sight. With all
her knowledge and all her cleverness, however,
she little knew her man.</p>

<p class='c010'>Towards the middle of December the influenza
began to abate, and on a certain evening
Tarbot came home early, entered his wife’s
drawing-room, and, flinging himself into a chair,
looked her full in the face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have earned a holiday,” he said. “It
will be possible for me to take it, and I mean
to do so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed!” she replied.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I am going into the country.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where to?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To Devonshire.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To Devonshire,” repeated Clara, sitting upright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, to Devonshire. Mrs. Pelham, I understand,
is now staying at the Towers, and
I want to see her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What for, Luke?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He was silent for a moment, staring full
into her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish to see Mrs. Pelham, Clara, for that
purpose which I mean no longer to delay in
putting into execution. I have discovered
beyond doubt that poison was administered
to Sir Piers Pelham. The poison, without
question, caused the child’s death. This poison
was given by Sir Richard Pelham, who is
now the owner of the property and the reigning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>baronet. Mrs. Pelham must know this
fact without delay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As he spoke Clara rose from her seat and
began to pace up and down the room. She
had the lithe, quick movements of the tigress.
She was wearing a dress with a dash of yellow
in it. The dress was made of velvet and clung
to her figure, which was lissom and graceful.
When her husband stopped speaking she
paused in front of him, her thin hands clasped.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you talk folly?” she said. “Why
do you disguise your intentions and talk to me
as if I did not know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because I think it best,” he replied. “We
never can tell when our words may fall on
other ears. That old proverb about the little
bird comes true now and again, Clara.
Understand once for all, that in this matter I
intend from first to last to treat Pelham as if I
myself believed in his guilt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are intolerable,” she cried, turning
away from him. “I cannot work with you on
those terms. If you will be above board, at
least with me, I can then make up my mind
whether I go with you or not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Make up your mind whether you go with
me or not?” he repeated in astonishment.
“Have you ever had any doubt?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Many times,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>He glanced at her, read something in her
downcast face and his own turned pale. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>starting to his feet he approached her. In an
instant both her hands were in his grasp.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you mean what you said just now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She looked up at him. Stout as her courage
was, something in his eyes made her heart
quail.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t mean it,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>He dropped her hands and gave a hoarse
laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you had really meant it I should have
killed you,” he replied. “Did I marry you for
you to fail me at the extreme moment? You
know the price you pay for your present position.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye, Luke,” she replied, “I do know the
price, and I’ll pay it gladly to the last drop of
my heart’s blood if only you on your part will
fulfil your side of the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want your love and you have never given
it to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That was never in the bargain, Clara.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In words it never was, but oh, you must
have guessed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She suddenly fell on her knees, her hands
were clasped together, she looked up at him
imploringly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think I would do what I did—that
I would make myself a by-word, a disgrace,
one of the cruellest women in existence, if I
had not hoped to win your love? Do you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>think I would do what I did simply for position,
a fine house, money? You do not know
me. Oh, Luke, Luke, give me what I crave
for. Sometimes I think my heart will break.
I would gladly do evil, commit crime for you,
but not when you are cold, cold as ice to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get up, Clara,” said Tarbot. “I cannot
listen to your words of folly. As to my loving
you, understand once for all that it is absolutely
out of the question. I do what I do
because—no, even to you I will not tell that
part. I have my reasons.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish you would tell me. I would not
betray you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never will tell you. Get up. Cease to
talk this folly or I shall despise you and be
even more cold to you than I have been of
late.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara rose slowly. Her mad passion was
over. Her face was white as death. She
coughed. Her cough was hoarse and hollow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are not well,” said Tarbot. “You
ought to do something for that cough.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is of no consequence, don’t notice it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, then, let us return to business. I
married you because in no other way could I
get what I wanted. If you fail me now you
know the consequences.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She did not reply, and he turned on his heel
and walked away from her. When he came
back again she had not stirred from her former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>position; her hands were still clasped tightly
together, her head was bent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you mean to defy me,” said Tarbot,
“you had better know the truth. I can be
terrible, cruel, dangerous to those who thwart
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t defy you,” she said then, making
a sort of gasping sound as she spoke. She
crouched away from him, and going up to the
mantelpiece leant her elbow on it. Tarbot
again paced up and down the room. After a
time he came up to his wife and spoke in his
usual tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I go to Devonshire to-morrow. I shall remain
there for a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You stay here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you going to Pelham Towers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall put up at the inn at Great Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the Pelhams will think it strange. They
will probably invite you to stay with them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They may invite, but I shall not accept.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean to do when you go to
Devonshire?” said Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t mind telling you. I shall see Mrs.
Pelham and acquaint her with the discovery
I have made with regard to the medicine
which was last given to Piers. She must be
the one to deal with the matter. She will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>deal with it because I shall force her to, but
she must take the initiative. In all probability
she will come back to London, she may even
want to see you. When she comes you will
know what to say to her, Clara. Remember,
I trust you. I shall leave here by an early
train in the morning. I am going out now to
arrange with my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">locum tenens</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who is he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dr. Dayrell. He will stay here, and will
see my patients until I return.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot left the room, and Clara found herself
alone. She still stood near the fire.
Something glittered in her eye. She raised a
cobwebby lace handkerchief to wipe it away—it
was a tear. Then she sank into the nearest
chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have heard the truth at last,” she said to
herself. “I shall never win his love. He has
paid me what he considers a good price—he
has made me his lawful wife. To the longest
day he lives, unless I die first, I shall be his
wife. He is rich and great, and I can share
both his riches and his greatness, only I never
married him for them. He will not believe
me, but it is true. He thinks that for the sake
of riches and greatness I shall be his tool and
accomplice, but with all his cleverness he has
not read my woman’s heart. If he loved me
I would go with him wherever he chose to lead,
but as he doesn’t love me, I am undecided—love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>like mine has been known to change to
hate. If such a thing should happen, Luke
Tarbot had better beware.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She rose from her seat now in her agitation,
and as she did so a pang sharp as a knife went
through her chest. She paused as if she were
stricken with death, and her breath came short
and sharp. After a moment she went up to
the glass and examined her face carefully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thin, thin to emaciation,” she said to herself.
“The bones protrude. Ah, how ugly I
grow! No wonder he cannot love me. And
this cough which I am always trying to suppress,
and the burning thirst, and the fever at
night, and the cold sweat—oh, great heaven!
I know the truth, but I will have my fears
confirmed, and now at this moment. I will
be a coward no longer. My friend, Dr. Mary
Murchison, will tell me the truth, and I would
rather hear it from the lips of a woman than a
man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara left the drawing-room, went to her
bedroom, put on her bonnet and warm mantle,
and went out. Walking quickly, she soon
reached Dr. Mary Murchison’s house in Queen
Anne Street. The lady doctor was at home,
and when Clara was ushered into her consulting-room
came at once to see her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mrs. Tarbot,” she cried, shaking hands
with her. “I am glad you have come, but
what can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>“I am here on a painful business,” said
Clara. “I am, as you know, a doctor’s wife,
but I would rather have the opinion of one
who is not related to me. I have been unwell
for some time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You look very bad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My lungs are, I know, affected. Will you
tell me how seriously they are involved?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Mary Murchison promised to comply.
She brought her stethoscope, Clara bared her
chest, and the doctor listened attentively.
After a moment or two she put down the
stethoscope and looked full at Dr. Tarbot’s
wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?” said Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still Dr. Murchison did not speak.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The truth, please,” said Clara again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very ill, Mrs. Tarbot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean that I am dying?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, yes, I do mean it. Both your lungs
are affected, one extensively, but both are
affected.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How long?” asked Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A few months, not longer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is no remedy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“None.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you very much. I must return
home now,” said Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But take care of yourself. You did wrong
to come out in the night air. How mad Dr.
Tarbot must be not to have discovered this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>long ago! He ought to have sent you to a
warmer climate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It doesn’t matter,” said Clara. “I thank
you for telling me the truth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She shook hands with Dr. Murchison and
left the house. She had not been absent from
her own house more than half an hour, and as
she reentered the house Tarbot met her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You were out,” he said. “Where were
you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I went to see my friend, Dr. Mary Murchison.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What about?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was asking her advice. I am not quite
well, Luke.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have noticed that,” he said slowly. He
looked at her with his cruel eyes. It seemed
to her then that they danced as if with malevolent
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will speak to you presently about your
health,” he said. “You may want a warmer
climate. I have noticed that cough. Don’t
go out again at night—it is unwise. I will
have a talk with you when I return from
Devonshire.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He nodded to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>She made no answer, but went up-stairs to
the drawing-room and sat down in her chair
once more by the fire. Once or twice she
coughed feebly; the cough gave her acute
pain, she put her hand to her thin chest;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>then, taking up a heavy Oriental shawl she
wrapped it round her figure. As she was doing
so, some one tapped her on the shoulder, and
she looked up with a start. Little Mrs. Ives
was standing before her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye, Clary, here I be,” said the little woman.
“I know well you didn’t expect me, and that
you didn’t wish me to come, but I’ve kept it
to myself for over a month and I can’t abear it
no longer. I told that fine servant of yours to
let me up. I took him by surprise and ran
past him up the stairs. You needn’t glare at
me like that, Clary, for here I be and here I’ll
stay till I know the whole truth. Aye, Clary,
my girl, I has found out your secret, and I
know the name of the child. He’s Sir Piers
Pelham, the rightful owner of Pelham Towers.
I don’t mean to keep that secret to myself any
longer.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <span class='large'>A BLACK CRIME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Ives’s appearance on the scene roused
Clara. She questioned her mother eagerly.
Very soon she had got to the bottom of the old
woman’s knowledge. Mrs. Ives completely
exonerated the boy of having broken his word.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s not a more truthful nor a braver
little chap in existence,” she cried. “He were
always a near telling me, dear lamb! The
whole thing worrited him awful, but he never
did tell, never. Because he had given his
word to you, Clary, nothing would make him
break it. I don’t think red-hot irons would
have wrung the truth from him, but he let it
out in his sleep, bless him. He was restless,
he had a bad headache. I gave him some
quieting medicine, and he went to sleep in my
arms, and in his sleep he began to talk and to
mention the name of Pelham and Pelham
Towers, and he cried out for some one called
Dick and for a young lady of the name of
Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll judge it were easy for me to put two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>and two together after that. But I thought I’d
make certain sure afore I come to you, Clary,
and I did. A month ago I went to Pelham
Towers and I saw the young lady, the baronet’s
wife, and I saw the housekeeper. I also saw
the family vault. Dear heart! I heard a
mighty piteous story about a coffin being put
in and about one who went into the vault and
who mourned as if his heart were broken. It
was a deep plot, Clary, a deep plot, but I ha’
found it out. It ain’t your secret any more.
It’s mine now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean to do?” asked Clara
at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me first if it’s true, Clary. I know it
is, but I’d like to hear it from your own lips.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, mother, it’s true,” said Clara slowly.
“Now I want to know what you mean to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must know all the reasons,” said the old
woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not at liberty to give you the reasons.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, Clary, my girl, you’ve done an awful
thing—something that will bring you under
the power of the law. Am I to stand the disgrace
of having one of my own locked up in
one of her Majesty’s prisons and going through
penal servitude, and being spoke of in all the
papers? I’m poor, but I’m honest, and I has
a respectable name, and this thing will kill me,
that’s what it will.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, mother, if you keep the secret the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>catastrophe you dread will never happen,” said
Clara. “You have only to keep it faithfully,
and all will be well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s very fine,” said the little woman;
“but the secret worries me. Why should the
boy be cut out of his own?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is absolutely necessary that for the
present he must remain unknown to his relatives,”
said Clara. “It is a deep and a dreadful
plot, mother, but it is too late to go back
now. I may as well confess that I am bitterly
sorry I ever took part in it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s worse than a plot—it’s a black crime,”
said the little woman. “Why, there’s the
mother of the boy mourning him as if he were
dead, and there was the old housekeeper crying
fit to break her heart, and the young lady who
has come in for all the money, she looked as
sad as sad could be when she spoke of him,
and they’re putting up a tablet to him in the
old church. Clary, it’s past bearing. ’Tain’t
likely as I’ll keep it burdening my soul. Even
for you I can’t do that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll do great and terrible mischief if you
let out what you know,” said Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why did you do it, Clary? ’Pon my
word, to think that a girl of mine should have
grown up such a desperate woman. You was
always masterful as a little ’un, but I didn’t
think you’d stoop to open sin—the sort of sin,
that means, to be tried and put in prison.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>Why, it’s very near murder. What do it all
mean, Clary?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It means something dreadful,” said Mrs.
Tarbot; “but I have put my hand to it, and
it is too late to turn back now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why did you do it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look at me, mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do look at you. I’m a-staring at you,
and I don’t think you look at all well. You’re
drawn and pale in the face past knowing. It’s
ugly to see the skin stretched as tight as that.
To be sure, you has a beautiful dress on, far
too grand for my taste—it looks something
like a snake’s skin. Why on earth did you
choose that color? Oh, dearie me, Clara, I
wouldn’t know you. I never did think you’d
grow up so wicked. It’s a pity the good God
didn’t take you when you was so bad with the
croup that time, when you was a little mite.
Oh, I prayed mighty ’ard that you might be
spared, but I wish now to my heart that I
hadn’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s no good in regretting the past,
mother. I am as I am. I don’t pretend to
be a good woman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, that you ain’t. You’re a rare bad ’un.
I wish I’d never brought you into the world.
It’s terrible to think what you ha’ done—it’s
terrible.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The poor old lady began to sob; she was
shaken to her very depths. Presently she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>raised her trembling old hand, and laid it on
her daughter’s cold fingers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give it up, Clary,” she said. “Confess
your sin, and give it up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot do what you want, mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why can’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You haven’t told me yet why you done
it at all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well, I’ll tell you. I suppose I was
mad at the time. Mother, did you ever love
anybody?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did I ever love anybody? Lawk a mercy!
to be sure I did. I loved your poor father,
and I loved my children when they come,
and I love you now, though you are such a
bad ’un, and I love that little chap. What
does this mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want you to consider, mother. The sort
of love you’re speaking about is not what I
mean. When you were engaged to my father,
and when you married him, did you ever feel
that you would have committed even a crime if he
wanted it, just because you loved him so well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A mercy me! no,” said the little woman.
She rose now and dropped a curtsey. “My
word! you are upsettin’, Clary. To be sure
I loved Thomas. He was a good man when
he wasn’t in his tantrums, but as to committing
a crime for him, no, no, nothing of that sort.
I wouldn’t have sinned for him, not I.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>“Then you don’t understand anything about
desperate, passionate love,” said the younger
woman. “You don’t understand the love I
feel. I love Luke, for years I have loved him.
What I did was my one and only chance of
winning him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you’re a greater fool than I gave you
credit for,” said the old woman. “It’s all past
bearing, and I don’t think I can keep the secret
any longer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sleep over it, mother,” said Clara. “You
are tired. I will get you a room ready for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I’d be frightened to sleep in this grand
house. I’ll go out and get a lodging near by.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, you won’t. I won’t have it said that
I turned my own mother out of doors at this
hour. You must sleep here. Come, I’ll take
you up-stairs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are as masterful as of old, Clary; but,
dear heart, I don’t like sleeping in a house of
this sort. However, as it’s late, and if you
promise to give me the smallest room and the
plainest you has, I’ll stay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; I can give you a nice little dressing-room
beyond mine, with a snug bed in it. I’ll
have a fire lit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sakes alive! don’t give me a fire in my
bedroom. I hates ’em past bearing, they’re
not healthy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well, mother, just as you please, but
it’s late now, and you must rest.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Clara took her mother up-stairs, gave her
every requisite for the night, and left her.
Then she went to her own room. Prepared
as she supposed herself to be for every possible
emergency, it had not occurred to her that
her mother would first discover her secret and
then refuse to keep it.</p>

<p class='c010'>She knew that the present danger was great.
Whatever she herself might resolve to do in
the future it would never, never do for her
mother to forestall her. The child must be
removed from the old woman, and if Mrs. Ives
did not promise to respect Clara’s secret she
would have to be deprived of her liberty. To
do this was no easy matter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE “PELHAM ARMS.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>On the following morning at an early hour
Tarbot, knowing nothing of the arrival of Mrs.
Ives, went down to Devonshire. He left the
train at the little station of Haversham, and,
taking a trap, drove straight to the “Pelham
Arms” in the village of Great Pelham, which
went by this name in contradistinction to Little
Pelham, which was four miles distant at the
other side of Pelham Towers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having secured the best room which the
“Pelham Arms” boasted of, Tarbot proceeded
to make himself comfortable. He ordered a
good dinner, unpacked his traps, and then took
a stroll to reconnoiter the place. He knew
Pelham Towers well, having been there in his
boyhood, and he wished now to revisit his old
haunts, and prepare for the campaign which
he had set himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he was returning to the inn, just as the
dusk was falling, a carriage passed him. The
occupants of the carriage were Barbara and
Mrs. Pelham. There was still light enough for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>them to recognize him. Barbara desired the
carriage to stop, and Tarbot went up to speak
to the two ladies.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you doing here?” asked Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have come down on special business,”
he replied. “I have a matter I want to consult
you about,” he added, looking full at Mrs.
Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Barbara spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why did you not tell us, Dr. Tarbot? We
could have put you up at the Towers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you,” he replied; “but I have taken
a very comfortable room at the ‘Pelham
Arms.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara paused for a moment. She did not
like Tarbot, and was sorry he had come to Great
Pelham, but as he was there she felt she must
be civil to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will dine with us to-night?” she said,
bending out of the carriage as she spoke and
looking at him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He glanced full up into her lovely eyes. Her
face caused his heart to beat wildly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will come,” he said in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara could not but observe his agitation.
She repented of having asked him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We dine at seven,” she said coldly, falling
back into her seat as she spoke. “We shall
expect you at that hour.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>He answered in the affirmative, and the carriage
bowled rapidly away.</p>

<p class='c010'>With his heart still beating faster than usual,
the man returned to the inn. The moment
had come for him to strike his great blow, but
the look in Barbara’s eyes disarmed him. After
all, he need even now do nothing. In his hand
lay potent and terrible possibilities—the power
to quench the happiness in those eyes, the
power to drive that young heart to the verge
of madness. After all, Pelham was only the
instrument with which he (Tarbot) should strike
at Barbara’s heart. If only even now she would
be kind to him—a little kind—he might reconsider
the situation; but then he began to say
to himself that she had never been unkind,
never since he had known her. It had always
been her way to be gentle and sweet, she was
that to all the world. He did not want her
sweetness; her indifference nearly maddened
him—she was sweet because she was indifferent.
He would rather have her hatred than
her indifference. Yes, hatred was better than
the condition which means neither love nor
hate. When he did what he meant to do, she
would hate him. In all the future of her life
he would stand before her as a monster who
had dragged her husband to disgrace, ruin,
and death.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, better that feeling than the present.
The time would come when she would plead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>with him. To see her at his feet pleading, imploring,
beseeching of him to withhold his
hand—ah, then indeed his revenge would be
accomplished. His heart quickened, he felt
happy, at being so far away from Clara. When
he thought of Clara his determination not to
spare Barbara grew and intensified in force.
Had he not married Clara in order to promote
his vengeance? If Barbara had married him, as
he had once told her, he would have been a good
man. She had rejected him, and he was a bad
one. On her own head the blame must fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>He wandered about, too restless to go indoors,
too restless to accept the invitation of
the jolly landlord of the “Pelham Arms” to
go into the bar parlor and have a smoke, too
restless to do anything but long intensely for
the moment when he might go up to the
Towers and look at Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>The time flew by, the hour arrived. He
dressed with care. He put a light overcoat
over his evening suit and walked the short distance
from the “Arms” to the Towers. He
arrived at the old place a few minutes before
seven o’clock. He was shown at once into the
rose drawing-room, a lovely apartment with
oriel windows of colored glass fashioned in
the shape of roses. The rose drawing-room
opened into wide conservatories, the doors of
which were unclosed, and the scent of many
exotics filled the beautiful room.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>Barbara, in a dress of white silk, stood near
the hearth. Neither Pelham nor Mrs. Pelham
had yet made their appearance. Barbara came
a step forward when Tarbot entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is your wife?” she asked. She
could scarcely have made a remark more displeasing
to Tarbot. He frowned and bit his
lips, then he answered shortly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“My wife is well, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you intend to make a long stay in
Devonshire?” was Barbara’s next commonplace
remark.</p>

<p class='c010'>He answered that circumstances would decide
that. Just then Mrs. Pelham came into
the room, followed by Dick. Dinner was announced,
and the party went into the dining
hall. The meal was a subdued one. Pelham’s
antipathy to Tarbot made itself felt. Notwithstanding
all his efforts, he could not be cordial
to his unwelcome guest. The men remained
for a short time over wine, and joined the
ladies soon afterwards in the drawing-room.
The moment they did so, Barbara went up to
her husband, slipped her hand inside his arm,
and led him into the conservatory. Tarbot
had hoped to have a few moments’ conversation
with her. He bit his lips as he saw what this
movement meant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She hates me; she cannot bear even to
give me ordinary civilities,” he said to himself.
“So much the better for my purpose.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>The next instant he found himself in a low
chair by Mrs. Pelham’s side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You said you wished to see me, Dr. Tarbot,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do,” he replied. “I am anxious to have
an interview with you on a matter of grave
importance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your looks frighten me,” she said. “What
can be very important to me now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What I am about to tell you will be of the
greatest importance. What time to-morrow
can we have our interview?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whatever time will suit you, Dr. Tarbot.
Your time is mine. I am not specially engaged
in any way. It is true that Barbara wants me
to go with her to Exeter to choose presents for
the villagers’ Christmas tree, but there is no
special hurry, and we can postpone our visit.
I shall be at your disposal. Will you come
here at eleven o’clock?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would it be possible for you to come to
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have reasons which you will appreciate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly, if you wish,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can secure a sitting-room where we can
be quite alone at the ‘Pelham Arms.’ May I
expect you at eleven o’clock to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” replied the widow.</p>

<p class='c010'>At that moment Barbara and Pelham entered
the room. Barbara sat down at the open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>piano and began to sing. She sang several
times, and her voice was rich, full, and pleasing.
Dick went and stood by her side. Between
the songs he and she spoke together in low
tones, just as if they were lovers. Presently
Tarbot, making an effort, went up and joined the
group. He could talk well, and he exerted himself
now to be agreeable. Presently his efforts
met their reward. Barbara ceased to distrust
him. He spoke of people and matters which
only Londoners would appreciate. Barbara
asked questions, put in suggestions, and enjoyed
the doctor’s clever epitome of society
gossip.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dick scarcely spoke. He was never much
of a talker, and his dislike to Tarbot increased
moment by moment. Once more the old suspicions
returned to him. Had the child come
by his death through natural causes? Pelham
had to remind himself of what the two great
consultants and the chemist had said before
his usual equanimity reasserted itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soon after ten o’clock Tarbot took his leave.
He shook hands first with Barbara, then he
went up to Mrs. Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall expect you to-morrow,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall be with you at eleven o’clock,” she
replied. He then left the room, Dick accompanying
him as far as the hall door.</p>

<p class='c010'>The moment Barbara and Mrs. Pelham were
alone Barbara spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>“I am glad that is over,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you dislike him, Barbara?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot explain what I feel about him,”
said Barbara impatiently. “By the way was
he making an appointment with you? I
thought we were to go to Exeter to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope, dear, that you will not mind putting
off the expedition until Friday, or, if that
is very inconvenient, will you go without
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course I will put it off if there is any
good reason for it,” said Barbara. “We can
go on Friday quite as well as to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dr. Tarbot wants to leave for London on
Friday morning,” said Mrs. Pelham, “and as
he wishes to see me on a matter of business I
appointed to-morrow at eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” said Barbara, tapping her fingers
lightly on the mantelpiece, “we must ask him
to lunch, I suppose. I frankly confess that I
shall be glad when he goes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I fear he must have guessed your feelings
towards him, for he refuses to come here. He
has asked me to meet him at the ‘Pelham
Arms.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara said nothing further, for at that moment
her husband reentered the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next day at the appointed hour Mrs.
Pelham put on her things and prepared to walk
to the “Pelham Arms.” Pelham met her in
the avenue and asked where she was going.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>“To the ‘Pelham Arms,’ to meet Luke
Tarbot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why doesn’t he come here?” said Pelham.
“He ought not to order you about in that
style.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He didn’t order me, Dick. I invited him
here, knowing that you and Barbara would give
me free leave to do so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course,” said Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he preferred seeing me at the ‘Arms,’
and as I had no excuse to offer, I of course
agreed. I shall be back before long. Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Won’t you have the carriage?” called Dick
after her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it is a lovely morning, and I shall enjoy
the walk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham reached the “Pelham Arms”
at three minutes to eleven. Tarbot was waiting
for her, he was standing on the steps, a cigar
in his mouth. When he saw her he threw
away the cigar and came forward to meet her.
His face was white, his lips looked thinner than
ever, and his eyes had a strained expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have secured a private sitting-room,” he
said; “we shall be quite undisturbed. Come
this way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham wondered what Tarbot wanted
with her, and what news could affect her seriously
now that the child was dead; she felt
distressed and nervous.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>Trembling a little, she followed the doctor
into a small room, at the back of the bar. It
smelt of cheese and stale beer. Tarbot went
to the window and threw it open. There was
a fire in the grate.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That makes the atmosphere more tolerable,”
he said. “I am sorry I could not invite you
to a nicer room.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The room matters nothing,” said Mrs.
Pelham. She untied her cloak as she spoke
and threw back the crêpe strings of her bonnet.
Her crêpe veil was up, her face looked pallid
and her dark eyes full of apprehension.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it, Luke? This mystery unnerves
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have some painful news to give you,” he
said; “the best way is to tell you quite simply
what I have discovered.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You remember that I asked you to let me
have the bottle which contained the medicine
little Piers took just before he died?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remember quite well, and you took all the
medicine bottles away. You said you wanted
to work up your case. What is it, Luke, what
is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something very grave has happened,” he
replied. “I have hesitated for some weeks to
tell you. The fact is, I have known this for
over a month; my wife also knows it, for I had
to confide in her. For a time I thought I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>would keep the whole matter to myself, but
I found that my conscience would not rest.
It seems to me you ought to know, that you
are the one to decide. The thing haunts
me. I can bear it no longer. That is the
reason why I could not come to Pelham
Towers to talk the matter over with you, for
it concerns—Richard Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what is it, Luke? I wish you would
speak out. I hate people to beat about the
bush. You have discovered something in the
bottle of medicine. By the way, Dick was
very queer when he spoke about that medicine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No wonder,” said Tarbot. “He came to
you about it, then? Yes, I remember, he told
me so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He did. He said he wanted to get the
medicine analyzed. It was a strange wish of
his, and it puzzled me at the time. Just as if
the dear child had come by his death by foul
means! Luke, what is it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham had been seated. Now she
stood upright, for something in the face of
the doctor had overbalanced her self-control.
Holding out both her hands, she clasped those
of Luke Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sit down; control yourself,” he said. “I
have bad news. I analyzed the medicine. I
found hyocene in it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hyocene? What is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>“A deadly poison.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Luke!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham had a dim feeling that the
curtain was going to be lifted from something
awful; the room seemed to go round. She
raised her hand and passed it across her brows.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot see,” she cried. “The room is
very hot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will open the window wider; take this
chair. You will understand what I have told
you in a moment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She did not speak, but, sinking back into
the chair, closed her eyes. Tarbot flung the
window wide open, poured out a glass of water
and brought it to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will recover in a moment,” he said.
“I knew it would be a terrible shock, and I
felt that it was best for you to see me here and
alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me again,” she said after a moment.
“There was in that medicine—what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hyocene.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And that is?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A deadly poison.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the child took it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But who put it there, Luke; who put it
there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mrs. Pelham, that is the question which in
my opinion the law must decide. One thing
at least is clear—the man who gave the boy his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>first and last dose out of that bottle was Richard
Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” said the widow. She clasped her
hands before her face. “Impossible!” she
cried. “You cannot mean it. Dick! Dick
give poison to my boy! No, no!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is true,” said Tarbot. “You must nerve
yourself to meet the truth. The boy has to be
avenged. I can stand the secret no longer—I
had to tell you. Sir Richard Pelham gave him
the dose.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /> <span class='large'>CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>After an hour of earnest whispered conversation
Mrs. Pelham rose.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot return to the Towers,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not? Your absence will look
strange.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot help it. It is impossible for me
to face either Barbara or Dick. I shall go to
London with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot considered for a moment. It had
not occurred to him that Mrs. Pelham would
do this, but after a little thought he considered
it a wise step.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well,” he said. “I am not greatly
surprised; but what about your things?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will send a note to my maid. She will
pack them and follow me this evening. I will
go to town with you, Dr. Tarbot. When does
the next train start?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot sent for a time-table. The next
train would leave Haversham within an
hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must have some lunch before you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>start, and then we will drive over to the station,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham bowed her head in acquiescence.
Her face looked gray and her eyes
strained, and there was a tense expression
about her lips as though she were keeping her
self-control with a mighty effort.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the lunch was brought in she managed
to eat a little, schooling herself to do so.
Then a trap was found, and the pair drove to
the station. Mrs. Pelham had written a brief
note to Barbara and also one to her maid. In
Barbara’s letter she had simply said—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Unexpected news obliges me to hurry to
town. Will write more fully on my arrival.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When they got to the station Tarbot took a
first class ticket for himself and another for
Mrs. Pelham. He tipped the guard to reserve
the carriage, and they traveled up to London
alone. Just as they neared the metropolis Mrs.
Pelham bent forward and touched Tarbot’s
hand with her fingers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have made up my mind,” she said. “I
will avenge the death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad of it,” said Tarbot. “I thought
you would feel so and act so. I knew there
was no other course open to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have not the least idea how to proceed,”
continued Mrs. Pelham, “but I shall not rest
day or night until Richard Pelham is arrested.
I have thought over all that you have told me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>and the evidence seems conclusive. Dick’s
gloom, his unaccountable and strange misery,
all that took place immediately after the death
of the child, can only be accounted for in the
one way. It is fearful; but there is not the
slightest doubt that the circumstantial evidence
against Dick is of the strongest nature. Yes,
I must take the necessary steps to bring him
to justice, and at once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are doing the right thing,” said Tarbot.
“A life for a life, remember. You have
the authority of Scripture for what you are
about to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham shivered and covered her face
with her hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I loved him well,” she continued. “This
very morning as I sat by his side at breakfast
I noticed how kind he looked. Dr. Tarbot,
are you sure of what you are telling me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am certain. The circumstantial evidence
is so strong that it will hang him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Great Heaven! If Dick dies by the hand
of the hangman I believe I shall go mad. I
feel almost as if he were a son to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Think what he did, and your feelings will
alter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is true. I hate him already. Oh,
my heart is torn.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will be better when you have done
what is right,” said Tarbot. “He will hang
for this.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>As the man spoke his lips slowly moved
apart. A diabolical smile flitted across his
face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will guide me,” said Mrs. Pelham.
“You will tell me what steps to take?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I must not do that. You must consult
your own lawyer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What, Mr. Carroll? He was one of dear
little Piers’s guardians.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carroll is a barrister, is he not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must put your affairs into the hands
of an able solicitor. Doubtless, Carroll will
tell you the right man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham was silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When we reach town you had better go
straight to Carroll and ask his advice. He
will tell you the proper man to employ. You
must have a very smart criminal solicitor. If
possible, you had better instruct Wilkinson.
You must have a criminal barrister also—Chartris
is your man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is all this necessary?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indispensable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I will go to Mr. Carroll when I get
to town.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do so. Carroll will give you all the necessary
counsel. Pelham ought to be arrested
as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.” Mrs. Pelham clasped her hands
together convulsively.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>“I have come up to town for no other purpose,”
she continued. “I shall not rest day
or night until my darling’s most cruel murder
has been avenged.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When you speak like that you act as a
brave and noble woman. A life for a life,
remember. I will be your friend through all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The train arrived at Paddington. Tarbot
saw Mrs. Pelham into a cab, and the driver
was desired to go straight to Carroll’s chambers
in Holles Street.</p>

<p class='c010'>Carroll happened to be in, and he saw Mrs.
Pelham at once. Her agitation and the strained
look on her face frightened him. He asked
her to sit down, and questioned her eagerly as
to what was the matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have come to consult you about the most
awful matter,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it, Mrs. Pelham? What can
possibly agitate you to such a fearful extent?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is something that Luke Tarbot has just
told me. On hearing the news I came to
town. Luke Tarbot has discovered that my
child, my little Piers, came by his death by
the administration of a most subtle poison.
An awful stuff called hyocene was put into his
medicine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Impossible!” said Carroll. “Who has
told you this?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>“Dr. Tarbot. For some reason he had
his suspicions, and he analyzed the medicine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But Tarbot was the doctor who attended
the case. He ordered the medicine to be
given himself. The man must be mad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He says the hyocene must have been put
into the medicine after it arrived from the
chemist’s. But the terrible fact that I am
coming to is this. Dr. Tarbot says that Dick
did it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Richard Pelham!” cried Carroll. “Richard
Pelham try to murder Piers! Impossible,
monstrous! My dear madam, you are the
subject of a terrible hallucination.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I were.” The poor woman clasped
and unclasped her hands. Her face was full
of terror and distress.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is true,” she repeated. “I could not
believe it myself at first, but I do now. The
circumstantial evidence is fearfully strong,
and it is all against Dick. I must prosecute
him. My child’s death must be avenged. I
have come to town for the purpose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is Tarbot? When did he bring
you this cock-and-bull story?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not a cock-and-bull story. You may
think so at first, but you will not when you
know all. Dick was in a fearful state after the
death—his agitation was unnatural. It points
strongly to his guilt.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>“Not to those who know the man,” said
Carroll.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should be more than thankful if anybody
could clear him,” replied Mrs. Pelham, “but
at present I think, nay, more, I am certain he
is guilty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are overwrought, and no wonder,”
said Carroll kindly. “Of course, I will look
into this matter. You must leave it to me.
Will you stay here while I interview Tarbot?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will find him at his house in Harley
Street. Yes, I will remain here until you
return.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is good. I will order the servants to
bring you some refreshment. You must have
something, it is necessary for you to husband
your strength. I will be off at once now to
Tarbot and then return to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Carroll left the room. He was absent
nearly an hour. At the end of that time he
came back, and his face was very grave.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I saw Tarbot,” he said, “and he has certainly
confided a strange tale to me. I don’t
even now believe in Dick’s guilt; but you are
right, Mrs. Pelham—the circumstantial evidence
is terribly strong. Have you quite made
up your mind to prosecute?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have. Can I allow the child’s death to
be unavenged?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have not a word to say if such is your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>wish. I will take you now to a solicitor whom
I know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dr. Tarbot wishes me to consult a solicitor
of the name of Wilkinson.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is a smart man, but I think I prefer
Cornish. John Cornish is very just, and has
had a vast amount of criminal practise.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just as you please, Mr. Carroll. I will put
myself into your hands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then we’ll go to Cornish. I will have a
hansom whistled for, and we’ll drive there at
once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham rose. In a few moments’ time
the pair were driving in the direction of Cornish’s
chambers in Lincoln’s Inn Fields. They
found him at home. Carroll had a brief interview
with the lawyer first; afterwards Cornish
saw the widow and took her instructions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will get a warrant immediately from the
magistrate of the district where the child died,”
he said. “Sir Richard Pelham will be arrested
early to-morrow morning.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE BOLT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It wanted now but three days to Christmas,
and Pelham and his wife were very busy.
They were happy in their new life, and all
Pelham’s suspicions had rolled away like
a cloud on a summer’s morning. He was
sorry for Piers, sorry for the child’s early
death, but his own life now fully occupied
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham was a good fellow. He was married
to the girl he loved. Day by day he saw more
of the charm and beauty of her character—she
was all his. To pour his riches at her feet,
to surround her with glory and honor were
his delight. Yes, he would live a good life,
the best life of all, for the sake of his tenantry
and for the sake of Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Pelham’s message and her sudden departure
puzzled the young couple.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What can it mean?” said Barbara. “Mrs.
Pelham was not going to leave us until long
after Christmas. My mother arrives to-morrow.
What can be the matter?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“She doubtless had her reasons,” said Pelham.
“She will write and tell you when she
gets to town.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder what Dr. Tarbot really wanted
with her?” continued Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham drew his wife to his side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t let us talk about Tarbot,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I dislike the man so cordially. What
about that Christmas tree?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara brightened up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall go into Exeter to-day,” she said,
“and I will buy the things necessary for
the tree there. Will you come with me,
Dick?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot. I have to see Manson about
the lease for the South Meadow Farm. It is a
lovely day, and you may as well drive over to
Exeter. The horses are eating their heads off,
and a long run will do them good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The pair had this conversation in their room
before they went down to breakfast. On the
breakfast table several letters awaited them.
Amongst others was one from Mrs. Evershed.
In this she announced her intention of arriving
at Pelham Towers by a certain train in the
afternoon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did not know that mother would choose
that train,” said Barbara. “As that is the case,
Dick, I will go to Exeter by train, for I can
just fit things in, and return in time to join
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>mother at Haversham station. We will then
drive home together.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well, dear, as you like.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall buy quite a cartload of things,” said
Barbara, laughing as she spoke. “I want this
Christmas tree to be the best the children have
ever seen. You may as well select a fir tree
for the purpose when you take your rounds
this morning, Dick.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara having finished her breakfast went
to the window.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How lovely things are looking!” she said.
“But it is cold. I should not be surprised if
we had a fall of snow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham joined his wife at the window. A
fairer scene could scarcely be found in the
length and breadth of England. The place
was covered with hoar frost, the rolling lawns
were skirted by great forest trees, there was a
lake in the distance, and a range of low-lying
hills stood out against the horizon. The high
road wound like a white ribbon through the
heart of the landscape. There was a peace
and a great silence over the scene. A robin
was hopping about on a bough near by looking
for his breakfast. Barbara opened the
window and threw out some crumbs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is all lovely, lovely,” she said. “Don’t
forget about the tree this morning, Dick. Let
it be a right royal one for the sake of dear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>little Piers. I am going to give the Christmas
tree in his memory, and I mean to talk about
him to the children.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham said nothing, and a thoughtful
look passed over his face. For a moment
his eyes became full of gloom, but Barbara
was too happy in her own reflections to notice
this.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-by, dear,” she said. “I must
hurry off. I have to give some directions
about mother’s room, and I shall try to catch
the 11.10 train.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She ran out of the room singing a light song
under her breath. Dick Pelham stood for a
moment where she had left him. Then, whistling
to his dogs, he went out.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the rest of the morning many duties
kept him busy, for he was an ideal landlord,
and looked into the smallest details himself,
but he found time to see Barbara off on her
expedition to Exeter. She was to drive to the
station, about four miles away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“God bless her!” said Pelham as he
watched the ponies, with their ringing bells,
trot down the avenue and then disappear from
view. His dogs still following him, he sauntered
down the avenue. He was to meet his
steward within an hour, but there was still
plenty of time. He had gone about a hundred
yards when an old man was seen hobbling up
the drive.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>“Well, Crayshaw, and what do you want?”
said Dick, pausing in his walk.</p>

<p class='c010'>The old man gazed up at him with bleared
and red eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ve got over it, and I’m glad,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Got over it! Got over what? What do
you mean, my good fellow?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s nigh upon the blessed Christmas, the
birth of Christ, and I want to unburden my
soul. I listened<a id='t301'></a> when I ought not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You listened! What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I saw you, Sir Richard, that night you went
down into the vault, the night the child was
buried. I saw you, and what’s more, I heard
you. You was ter’ble upset. For a man who
had just come in for a title and a lot of money,
you was upset past natural. Yes, yes. I saw
it and I heard, and I want to unburden my
soul now. You was ter’ble upset, Sir Richard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham colored with annoyance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where did you say you were?” he asked
after a pause.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just ahint the old yew tree. Oh, I never
told, never except once, and that to an old
woman, a strange old body who didn’t know
these parts. She come here a month back.
I told her and she was ter’ble interested. It
was wonderful for a man like you to go right
down into the vault, and then to groan. Your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>groans down there was enough to turn a body’s
head. I won’t deny that the frights didn’t take
hold of me, for they did, and I run home with
my hands to my ears and trusting that none of
the sperrits of the dead and gone Pelhams
would come after me. But you’re better now,
you’re all right now. You has accepted your
riches in a thankful sperrit, and that’s as it
ought to be.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, things are as they ought to be,” said
Pelham after a pause. “See, here, Crayshaw,
don’t talk about this matter. I will own that
I was much upset that time. Here’s a sovereign
for you. You understand what I mean,
Crayshaw—keep your own counsel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A word to the wise is allers enough,” mumbled
the old man out of his almost toothless
gums. He clutched hold of the sovereign
and slipped it into his pocket. As he hobbled
away he said to himself—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Seems to me this ’ere secret of mine is
going to become valuable. I got a shilling
from that old woman, and here’s a sovrin now
from the guv’nor. I’ll make use of this secret
seems to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He hobbled away to find the nearest public-house,
in order to spend a portion of the
money. As he sipped his mug of beer he
nodded mysteriously to his companions and
told them that he had suddenly discovered a
little mine of gold, but he did not tell them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>what it was; he only excited their curiosity to
a considerable extent.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the old man disappeared up the avenue
Pelham turned to the left. He did not know
himself why he did so, but the old man’s
words had disturbed him and brought back
some of the melancholy which had caused his
early married days to be so miserable.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a fool I was!” he said to himself.
“It was really a case of nerves, for if ever a
man was possessed of a mad frenzy to his
own undoing, I was that fellow. I felt certain
when I went down into that vault that a murdered
child lay there. The thought maddened
me. Money was nothing to me, even Barbara
did not seem of the slightest consequence.
To win her was little to me then. I was full
of the one sole maddening fear that Piers had
come by his death by foul means. But those
two great consultants in London set me
straight, and the chemist finished the business.
It is odd though that I still distrust
Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What did he come sneaking down here
about, and why did Mrs. Pelham go off to town
so suddenly? I hate the man still and I distrust
him more than ever. He would do me a
mischief if he could—not a doubt of that. By
the way—I am sorry old Crayshaw heard me
groaning in the vault.” Dick paused in his
rapid thoughts to go up to the tomb of his ancestors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>and bend over it. “By the way,” he
considered, “Barbara wishes to have the service
in the chapel on Christmas Day. I may
as well look in and see if it is all right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He entered the chapel, the door of which
stood open, and went and stood under the
tablet. He read the inscription to little Piers.
It was a simple one, and a suitable verse of
Scripture was engraved under it. He turned
on his heel and went out.</p>

<p class='c010'>In spite of himself, and very much to his
own wonder, he found little by little his good
spirits slipping away from him. He could not
account for this, but he had to admit that it
was the case. He entered the little churchyard,
and crossed again to where the gloomy
vault of the Pelhams stood.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a hideous place!” he said to himself.
“How improved are the modern ideas with
regard to burial!”</p>

<p class='c010'>As he stood close to the vault, with his hand
resting on the stone which contained inscriptions
to his dead and gone ancestors, he
thought again of that night of terror when he
had gone down the steps and passed the
gloomy portals. He remembered the look of
the place as the lantern threw its strong light
upon it, the coffins ranged on their shelves,
some on the floor. He remembered that he
had trampled on the rotten boards, some of
which creaked under his weight. Finally he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>had stood close to the shelf where the coffin
of the youngest baronet of the house had just
been placed. He recalled it all now—the
damp feel of the place, the weird light from
his lantern, his own grief and oppression, nay,
even terror.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must have been mad at the time,” he said
to himself. As he said the words a hand was
laid on his arm. He turned quickly. A man
in plain clothes, a total stranger, was standing
near him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Am I right in supposing that I am addressing
Sir Richard Pelham?” asked the man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is my name,” said Dick. He started
back as he spoke. “Who are you?” he continued.
“I do not know your face.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am a stranger to these parts, sir; but I
have come here to say a word to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As the man spoke he slipped his hand into
his pocket and took out something.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mate is waiting outside,” he said
gravely, “and I have got a dog-cart handy. I
have a warrant here for your arrest, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For my arrest?” cried Pelham.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Sir Richard, for your arrest on suspicion
of having murdered the late Sir Piers
Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The words fell on Dick’s ears without at
first conveying any impression. The man repeated
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You had better come quietly, sir,” he continued.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>“As I said just now, I have a trap
outside, and if we drive off at once to Haversham
station we can take the next train to
town. Anything you say now, sir, will be used
against you, so you had best be silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stop a minute. I must think,” said Pelham.
He took off his soft cap and put up his
hand to his forehead as if to brush away some
hair. His brain was in a whirl, but his first
consecutive and clear thought was for Barbara.
When she returned home that night he would
not be there; she would miss him, she would
wonder what had become of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course there is a mistake,” thought the
young man. “I don’t quite comprehend it,
but Barbara, whatever happens, must not be
frightened.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned and looked at the man who had
come to arrest him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will go with you, of course,” he said.
“The matter will doubtless be cleared up immediately,
but I should like first to leave a
note for my wife. Do you permit it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir, provided I come with you to the
house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You need not do that,” said Pelham. He
shrugged his shoulders, took his pocket-book
out of his pocket, tore a leaf from it and wrote
a few words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Darling</span>,—I am called to town on sudden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>business. Do not be uneasy. I hope to return
to-morrow.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yours, <span class='sc'>Dick</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He folded the note and gave it to a gardener
who was passing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take this to the house,” he said, “and tell
the servants to deliver it to your mistress when
she returns.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man took it without the least apparent
curiosity and went away. Then Pelham
turned to the police constable.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am at your service,” he said. “I presume
you will not think it necessary to handcuff
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you are to be trusted, sir,” said the
man.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pelham nodded, and the ghost of a smile
flitted across his lips. A moment later he
was driving to Haversham in the company of
the two police constables. When they reached
the station they took tickets in a third-class
compartment; one of them tipped the guard
to allow them to have it to themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dick sat in a corner and kept looking out
at the landscape. Surely this was a dream,
and he would wake presently to find it was so.
His thoughts were busy, but not greatly with
himself. He felt a certain sense of satisfaction.
His old suspicions were right—there was something
unnatural about the death of the child.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>It was strange why he was arrested. Of course,
he was the wrong man—Tarbot was the guilty
person. Why had they arrested him? This
journey was unpleasant, but to-morrow, at the
farthest, before the magistrate, he, Dick Pelham,
would be abundantly cleared. Tarbot,
beyond doubt, was the guilty person.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXI.<br /> <span class='large'>GONE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>On the night that Clara Tarbot faced the
awful fact that she was not long for this world,
that consumption had claimed her for its prey,
and when she had also discovered that her
great secret was in jeopardy, and that at any
moment her husband’s plans would be brought
to utter ruin, Mrs. Ives was also restless and
uneasy. Mrs. Ives did not like sleeping in
Luke Tarbot’s house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It don’t suit me,” said the little woman to
herself, “a bed like this. I want my feather
bed. I don’t like these sort of springs under
me—shaky and unnatural, and mighty like
earthquakes they seems to me. And I don’t
like carpets all over the floor, unwholesome
they is, they don’t let enough air in, and you
can’t clean ’em often enough, and I hates
heavy curtains to the winders.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Finery don’t suit me, nor luxuries—I
weren’t born to ’em, and the worst of it is that
Clary, my own darter, don’t suit me neither.
No, she nor her ’ouse ain’t my sort. I hope to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>goodness I’ll soon be able to get out of this.
I’ll get back to Cornwall as fast as ever I can
go. If I don’t go away she’ll be after wringing
a promise out of me. Well, I just won’t
make it—I’d rather a deal lose the money.
What’s money, after all, if it only brings you
things like this? My word! my old bones
will be shook into a jelly if I lie much longer
on this bed. I can’t move without the thing
jumping under me. I’ll be out of this house
at dawn.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives sat up in bed. The perfectly-balanced
springs annoyed her much; finally
she rose and seated herself on a hard-bottomed
chair. There were two or three easy chairs
in the room, but she chose the hard and stiff
one by preference.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s it,” she said. “Now I’m easy. I
can turn and twist, and the thing don’t rock
under me. Now I can think for a bit. Clary,
my own darter, is agen me, I can see that.
Well, I’ll be off afore she knows anything
about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a clock on the mantelpiece. Mrs.
Ives found herself watching the hours. The
clock struck one, two, three, then four. When
it gave out its four strokes Mrs. Ives began to
tidy herself in front of the glass. She was
careful not to make the slightest noise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“For Clary wor always a light sleeper,” she
said to herself. She poured a little water with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>great skill and care into the heavy basin,
grumbling at the weight and beauty of the jug
as she did so. At each process of her toilet
she objected more and more to the comforts
which surrounded her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ’ates them soft towels,” she muttered to
herself, as she dried her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having dressed and once more arranged
her little black shawl and her neat poke bonnet,
the old woman made for the door. She
took a long time opening it, but she succeeded
at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara, who had been awake until an hour
before, was now in heavy slumber. This was
her time for repose. Tarbot was not in the
house, the servants’ rooms were far away. Mrs.
Ives stole like a thief down-stairs. Step by
step she went, holding her candle high and
looking straight before her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear heart, what a gloomy sort of place!
If this is what grandeur and riches mean, give
me poverty,” she muttered to herself. “Clary,
you don’t get no promise out of me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>By and by she reached the hall, and the
next moment found herself standing by the
door. It was bolted and chained, but Mrs.
Ives saw to her relief that it was not locked.
She could manage to remove the bolts and
chains. In a few seconds she was out in the
open air. She gave a little skip and spring
of delight, and running down the steps walked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>nimbly up the street. “I’ll walk to Paddington,”
she said to herself. “I don’t know when
the next train goes to Falmouth, but it’s sure
to start early. Dear heart! how refreshing
the morning air is! Give me poverty and
fresh air and a feather bed. None of them
springs for me again. My darter will be in a
state, but I ain’t agoin’ to promise her, not I.
I’ll take little Sir Piers back to Pelham Towers,
that I will. I won’t hold that awful secret
another day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives, busy with her thoughts, stepped
cheerfully along. Presently she saw a policeman
walking by. She quickened her steps
almost to a run and went up to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My good sir,” she said, “can you tell me
the way to Paddington?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The policeman gave her directions and she
walked on again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I had asked him when the next
train started for Falmouth,” she said to herself,
“but perhaps he wouldn’t ha’ known.
Dear heart! how hunted Clary do look! She
ain’t at all a nice sort, not at all. She never
wor, and she grows less so as she gets older.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives continued her walk. From
Harley Street to Paddington was scarcely thirty
minutes’ walk. She arrived at the great terminus
soon after five o’clock, and found to her
relief that a train started for Falmouth at 5.30.
She took her ticket, and, as soon as ever she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>could, seated herself in the corner of a third-class
compartment. It was cold at this hour,
but Mrs. Ives was made of stern metal, and
she drank in the keen air with appreciation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A sight better than Clara’s stifling house,”
she thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>A porter was passing and she called out to
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When does this train arrive at Falmouth,
my good man?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Four-eighteen,” replied the man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My word—a long time! But never mind,
I’ll be there in time for his tea—bless ’im!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The porter did not know to whose tea she
alluded, but did not stop to inquire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He allers likes his tea with me,” continued
the little woman, “and he shall have it to-night
with a fresh egg and a little honey. Honey
agrees with him wonderful. He’s a splendid
child. I love ’im better than I loves Clary.
Clary takes after her father. My word, how
thin and ugly she have grown! I shouldn’t
be surprised if she had caught the consumption
same as her father died of.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Punctual to the moment the train steamed
out of the station. Mrs. Ives settled herself
comfortably in her corner, looked around her
and chuckled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ha’ done it now,” she thought. “I’ll
talk to the little chap to-night and I’ll take
him back to-morrow. I’m sorry for the pretty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>young lady. It’ll go hard with her and her
husband returning to poverty. Well, never
mind, hardships must be borne once in a way,
and poverty ain’t none so bad. I ha’ tasted
riches, and I’d a sight sooner have poverty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives made a sniff of approval and flung
down the window.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sakes, this keen air is refreshing,” she
said. “That house with its curtains was
enough to stifle a body.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The train was punctual in arriving at Falmouth,
but Mrs. Ives had still two miles to
complete her journey. Her little cottage was
situated in a village a mile outside the big
town. As she walked she began to have a
strange and almost painful longing to clasp the
boy in her arms, to kiss his white forehead, to
look into his deep and lovely eyes, to hear his
shout of rapture when she told him that through
no fault of his she had discovered his secret,
and that in spite of Clary he was going home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll miss him,” she said to herself, “but
any one can see that he frets a good bit—poor
lamb! He won’t fret any longer now. Yes,
I’ll miss him sore, but I’ll always feel deep
down in my heart that I took him back to his
own, and that I foiled Clary, who’s turned so
monstrous wicked. It’s a terrible thing to
think of one’s own darter coming so low, but
I won’t be the one to connive at her wickedness.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>Mrs. Ives’s little cottage was on the outskirts
of the village. The lights were burning in the
cottage windows as she walked down the street.
No one noticed her as she went by. Had
the village folk done so they might have had
news.</p>

<p class='c010'>By and by she entered her own cottage.
When she had gone away she had left a village
girl in possession. The name of the girl was
Mary Welsh. She was a round-headed, blue-eyed
girl, with a flat face, and a keen, clever
way about her. Mrs. Ives had given her directions
with regard to little Piers. She was to
play with him, but not to encourage him to talk
about his fancies. He was to be out a good
deal, for, Christmas as the season was, it was
pleasant in the neighborhood of Falmouth, and
not specially cold.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ain’t they got no fire and no light? How
mortal dull for the little chap!” she said to
herself as she noticed that the house was in
darkness. But the next moment it occurred
to her that Mary Welsh might have taken the
boy to have tea with her own people. Such a
proceeding would be very wrong on the part
of Mary, but, nevertheless, she might have
committed the crime.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where are you, little chap?” called out
Mrs. Ives as she lifted the latch. There was
not a sound or a movement—the place was
empty. Mrs. Ives knew where the matches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>were kept. She found the box, struck a match
and lit a candle. The fire was out, the place
was in confusion. A telegram lay on the
table.</p>

<p class='c010'>“From Clary, but I ain’t a-going to mind
her,” said Mrs. Ives. She went into the little
bedroom; both the beds were in order, but
there was not a sight of the child anywhere.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear, dear, and I’m fagged out. Yes, I’m
beginning to feel the journey now,” she said to
herself; “but there’s no help for it. I must
go off to Mary’s. Now what does this mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a sound of footsteps running
quickly. The next moment the house door
was flung open and Mary rushed into the
room. The moment she saw Mrs. Ives she fell
on her knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It weren’t my fault, and don’t you go
a-blaming me,” she called out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?” said Mrs. Ives.
“Get up and speak plain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had nothing to do with it. I just left him
for five minutes, and where he’s gone off to
Heaven only knows.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where—who’s gone—what are you talking
about?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The child, little Piers, he slipped off yesterday
in the darkness. I was with him and
had just given him his supper, and I said I’d
come back in a few minutes, and when I did
there wasn’t a sight of him. Mother and me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>and all the village have been looking for him,
and we ain’t seen him, none of us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You get out of my house this minute,” said
Mrs. Ives. “A nice girl you are to have the
care of a little gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl disappeared. There was something
awful at that moment in the little woman’s
flashing eyes. She walked to the door, locked
it, then she lit her lamp and sat down to think.
The boy was gone—but where? What could
be the matter? Had any misfortune befallen
him?</p>

<p class='c010'>Amid all her wild dreams the possibility that
the boy might himself try to get back to his
old home had never once occurred to her, but
now it did. She nodded her head several
times.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Deary me! there seems likely to be no
rest for me this blessed night,” she said. “I
must try to take the next train to Haversham.
I wonder if there’s one to-night; most likely
not, but anyhow, back I must go to Falmouth
to find out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She did not wait even to get herself a cup of
tea. When she reached the town she was
greeted with the information that by no possible
means could she get across country to
Haversham that night. There would be a
train at eight o’clock on the following morning.
She must wait until then.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what is the matter, ma’am?” said the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>old clerk, who knew her well, having seen her
often before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a bad job,” she answered, “and I
want to hurry as fast as I can. There’s a little
gentleman missing, and more hangs on him
than words can say. You didn’t see a pretty
little gentleman, dressed common enough, but
with the air of the nobility, asking for a ticket
here yesterday evening, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives went on to describe the boy. She
spoke with glowing terms of his rosy face, his
dark eyes and his black hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>No, the clerk had seen no such little gentleman.
He thought Mrs. Ives must be slightly off
her head. She turned away in the darkness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br /> <span class='large'>BARBARA HEARS STARTLING NEWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was on the very day that Pelham was
arrested on a charge of murder, and Barbara,
happy and unconscious, had gone to Exeter to
buy presents for the Christmas tree, that Mrs.
Ives began her search for Piers. Having had
time to think during the night, she resolved
not to begin by going to Pelham Towers. The
boy had no money, of that she was well aware.
It would be out of his power to walk the distance
from Falmouth to Great Pelham under
several days, besides he would not know the
way. Beyond doubt, he was still in the immediate
neighborhood. Mrs. Ives would make
inquiries in her own vicinity first.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s such a pretty little dear that any one
might kidnap him,” she said to herself. “I
hope to goodness there ain’t no gipsies about.
I’ll go to the different villages and make inquiries,
and I’ll offer a reward. I’ll write it out
and I’ll put it up on my door the first thing in
the morning. I’ll spend a pound over Piers.
It’s a deal of money, but I’ll spend it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>So, taking tremendous pains, the little
woman wrote in large characters:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='large'>ONE POUND REWARD.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Wanted, a little boy, aged seven, named Piers.
Complexion dark, with rosy cheeks, eyes dark
and shining like stars. Black hair, all curled.
A nobleman-in-disguise sort of appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having fashioned this description to her
own mind, Mrs. Ives proceeded to post it on the
door of her house. She had printed it partly,
in red ink and partly in black. “Nobleman-in-disguise
sort of appearance” was all done
in red ink. It was the kind of advertisement
to attract immediate attention. As soon as
daylight came she began her round of the
village. She then went to the neighboring
villages. Wherever she went she made inquiries.
Here and there she posted up her
queer advertisement. She was very weary and
tired now, but still her courage never flagged.
She got no hint of the boy’s whereabouts
from any one. No one had seen or heard of
him, but all the villagers were interested and
promised to look out. As far as they could
tell, there were no gipsies in the neighborhood.
Mrs. Ives went home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must do it. I must go off to Pelham
Towers afore the last train goes to night,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>said to herself. “But first I’ll just read this
telegram from poor Clary.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The telegram was brief. It simply contained
a request on the part of Clara that Mrs. Ives
would do nothing until she saw her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives once again dipped her pen in the
ink and wrote a telegram to Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Boy gone. Am off now to Pelham Towers
to find him. Your mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When she got to Falmouth Mrs. Ives sent
off this message. She then took a ticket to
Haversham, and in course of time was put
down at the little wayside station. It was a
long walk from there to the Towers, but when
her spirit was up the little woman was good
for anything.</p>

<p class='c010'>Accordingly she was once more trudging
down the avenue when Barbara was returning
from Exeter. Barbara had had a successful
day, and driving back in the pretty pony carriage
with her mother wrapped in furs by her
side, she was chatting and laughing gaily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do declare,” she said, “there’s that funny
little old woman again!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What little woman, dear?” said Mrs.
Evershed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Her name is Ives. What can she want
now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara pulled up the ponies. She leant
out of the carriage.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good evening, Mrs. Ives,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>“Oh, good evening, my pretty young lady,”
said Mrs. Ives, dropping her accustomed curtsey.
“I’m in a sore bit of trouble, and I’ve
come back here thinking perhaps you could
help me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I can I will right heartily,” said Barbara.
“But you look very tired, and there is
plenty of room in the carriage. Please get in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Evershed made a gesture of disapproval,
but Barbara could afford to take no
notice of her mother. Mrs. Ives interested
her. She thought she would like to show the
little woman to Dick. Barbara’s heart was full
of Dick. She had not been parted from him for
so long a time since their marriage. She had
a great deal to tell him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Step in. Take this seat,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives did so.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m mighty obliged. I’m very footsore,”
said the little woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara whipped up the ponies and proceeded
at a rapid pace down the avenue. Mrs.
Ives sat quite silent, staring full in the face of
the pretty young lady.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can deal her a blow, and, dear heart! I
don’t like to do it,” she said to herself. “But
after all, what is riches? I ha’ tasted them at
my darter’s and they’re a grand mistake. It’s
a sight better to live poor and live plain. Yes,
that’s what I say—live poor and live plain.
Have plain food and a plain bed and cleanliness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>round you, and you don’t want for nothing.
That’s the way to live and have a long
life, and no encouraging of stoutness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As these thoughts flew through Mrs. Ives’s
active brain she glanced at Mrs. Evershed, who
was decidedly broad and fully developed. Mrs.
Ives did not like the grand lady, and did not
trouble to look at her again.</p>

<p class='c010'>They presently reached the house. Barbara
helped her mother out of the carriage and then
turned to Mrs. Ives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you come into the hall?” she said.
“This lady is my mother, and I want to see to
her comforts. If you will stay in the hall I
will come back to you presently.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara conveyed Mrs. Evershed up-stairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you talk to that sort of person,
Barbara? It’s not at all good taste,” said Mrs.
Evershed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, mother, where does the bad taste come
in? She’s such a little character, quite an
oddity, and I enjoy her,” said Barbara. “I
wonder where Dick is!”</p>

<p class='c010'>A servant, who had been hovering about,
now came forward with Dick’s note.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir Richard said you were to receive this
immediately on your return, my lady,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara opened the note, read the contents,
and her face turned white.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>“What can be the matter?” she said aloud.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is anything wrong, dear?” asked Mrs.
Evershed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, nothing that I know of; but Dick had
to go to town unexpectedly. He says he’ll be
back to-morrow. I wonder what can be the
matter! He said nothing at all about going
to town when I was leaving this morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir Richard went away in a dog-cart with
two strange men,” volunteered the footman.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara’s surprise and curiosity became
still greater, but she would not condescend to
question the man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s all right,” she said in a would-be cheerful
tone. “Let me take you to your room,
mother. I hope the fire is good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Evershed thought nothing of Dick’s
disappearance. On the contrary, she was
rather pleased than otherwise to have her
daughter to herself for the first evening.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The house is wonderfully pretty, dear,”
she said. “More than pretty, quite handsome,
but it really ought to be re-decorated. That
splendid old tapestry, for instance, is quite
thrown away in its present position. Now, you
ought to go to——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I like things as they are,” interrupted Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course, my dear child; but without in
the least disturbing the old ancestral appearance
of the place you could accentuate the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>points. I know a man who will help you. His
terms are enormous, but what can you expect
when he does so much for the money.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, mother, we will talk about that presently.
Now, this is your room. I hope you
will find it comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The apartment in question was a splendid
one and very spacious. Barbara’s maid was
waiting to unpack Mrs. Evershed’s things.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will leave you now to the care of Marshall,”
said the younger lady. “Marshall, please
bring tea to Mrs. Evershed in this room. We
dine at seven, mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara left the room. In the passage outside
she stood still for a minute. There was
no one by. She slipped her hand into her
pocket and took out Dick’s note. It was written
in pencil on a torn page of his pocket-book.
The few words were quickly read, but Barbara
lingered long over the “Darling” with which
the note was begun. Suddenly raising it to
her lips she kissed the signature; then, tenderly
folding it up, she put it back in her
pocket.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I knew what has really happened,”
she said to herself. “He knew nothing whatever
about this business when I left him this
morning. I hope nothing is wrong.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In her disappointment about her husband
not being at home, she forgot all about Mrs.
Ives. When she returned to the hall the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>little woman was still seated on one of the
chairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I am sorry I forgot all about you,” said
Barbara. “Did you wish to see me about
anything?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, yes, my lady, I should like to ask
you one or two questions.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come in here. This is my husband’s study,
and we shall be quite uninterrupted.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara opened a door to the left of the hall
and entered first. Mrs. Ives followed her.
Barbara closed the door behind her guest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And now what is it?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, my lady, I have come here to know
if by any chance a little boy has arrived during
the last twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t understand,” said Barbara. “A
little boy—what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A very pretty little boy, my lady,” said Mrs.
Ives, speaking slowly, her eyes fixed on Barbara’s
blooming face. “Brown eyes he had,
deep and soft, a wonderful look in ’em, starry
eyes, I call ’em, and a little brown face with
roses in his cheeks, and black hair all curly,
and his name, my lady, is Piers. Has he come
here within the last twenty-four hours?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly not. What a strange question
to ask. A boy called Piers. Why, that is the
name of the dear little fellow who died three
months ago.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was thinking of that, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>“But what can you mean? The child you
describe is exactly like the little Piers who
died. Please explain yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can do it in a few words, my lady. I has
had the care of a little boy just as I have described,
with the air of the nobility about him,
and a splendid way and brave, brave as a hero
of antiquity, but he’s lost, my lady. I went to
town to see my darter, Clara Tarbot what now
is—she looks mortal bad—riches don’t agree
with her. I saw my darter on the subject of
the little boy, and when I come home he was
gone. I thought maybe he’d come here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot understand it,” said Barbara. She
began to tremble. She did not know why.
“A little boy whom you had the care of called
Piers, with that sort of appearance, and you
thought he would come here. But why
should he come here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had the thought, my lady. I ain’t prepared
to say what gave birth to it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been out of the house all day,” said
Barbara after another pause, “but I will of
course inquire. If you will stay where you are
I can soon let you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara left the room. The little woman
clasped her hands and looked straight before
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is his house,” she said to herself, “and
the room is a beautiful one—heaps of air, big,
lofty. If I don’t soon get tidings the police
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>must be told that he’s not an ordinary little
boy, but Sir Piers Pelham himself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lady Pelham returned, and her face was pale.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have made inquiries,” she said, “but no
little boy has arrived to-day. It is late, and I
will give you a bed for the night. The child
you have been taking care of may turn up in
the morning, but I cannot possibly imagine
why you should think he was coming here.
Would you like to stay here for the night?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s late,” said Mrs. Ives, “and my bones,
they do ache terrible. Ha’ you got a feather bed
and a room without curtains and bare floor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara could not help smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I daresay we can accommodate you with
what you require in one of the attics,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I will stay, for the child may come
in the morning. Did you ask Mrs. Posset if
the child had come?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly, I went to Mrs. Posset first of all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what did she say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your description made her cry. I had to
explain that——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What, my lady?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That it could not have been our little boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And why not, my pretty lady?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because I saw him after he died,” said
Barbara. “Oh, you make my heart ache when
you talk of him. He is dead and in his grave.
Now I will take you to the housekeeper. She
will give you a comfortable room for the night.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>A MOMENT OF TRIUMPH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>By the morning post Barbara received a
letter from Dick. It was short, and its contents
were startling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Dearest Barbara</span>” (he wrote),—“Something
very bad has happened. I dare not and
will not tell you what it is, but it is just possible
that I shall be obliged to remain in town for a
day or two. Please don’t be frightened, darling.
The machinations of the wicked seldom
prosper, and I have not the slightest doubt
that everything will turn out right in the end.
If you do not hear from me or see me for a
few days try to keep calm and cheerful, for I
am convinced that I shall soon be able to return
to you, and that this most dark cloud will pass.
My promise, however, to come back to Pelham
Towers to-morrow I find impossible to fulfil.</p>

      <div class='line'>“Yours ever, my darling,</div>
      <div class='line in24'>“<span class='sc'>Dick</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Barbara was standing near the breakfast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>table when she read this letter. She read it
once, twice, and even three times. After the
third perusal she put it in her pocket. Mrs.
Evershed had entered the room. She was
standing near a glorious fire, for the weather
happened to be intensely cold, and her eyes,
dark and sunken, were fixed upon her daughter’s
face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it, Barbara? Have you news of
your husband?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have had a letter from him,” said Barbara
slowly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He returns home to-day, does he not?”
said Mrs. Evershed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I thought you said he would come
back to-day?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So he told me in the note I received yesterday,
but he finds it impossible to do so.
Mother, do you greatly mind if I leave you
here, and go up to London?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To London?” said Mrs. Evershed. “But
what for, Barbara, what for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish to see Dick.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear child, you look quite mysterious.
Is anything wrong?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope not, but I am not sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Won’t you tell me, Barbara?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot, mother, for I do not know myself.
Dick, it appears, is in some sort of
trouble. Will you stay at the Towers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>look after things and let me be free to go to
town? Otherwise I cannot rest—I cannot
really, mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You look strange, Barbara, and frightened.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am frightened,” said Barbara. “I do
not know why, but I am.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sit down, dear, and have some breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will look after things here, and set me
free to go up to town?” repeated Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course, my love, although I think it
most unnecessary for you to go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must decide for myself on that point,”
said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Evershed said nothing more. Barbara
crossed the room and rang the bell. When
the servant appeared she ordered the carriage
to be round within half an hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall catch the ten o’clock train from
Haversham,” she said, as she seated herself
before the coffee urn.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Barbara, my dear, you are trembling.
You must not give way,” said her mother.
“Indeed, I am convinced there is no cause for
alarm. You have had little to do with men
hitherto, my poor child, and do not know
what queer creatures they are, with their ups
and downs and their mysteries, and their sudden
departures from home. Oh, I had plenty
of that sort of thing to go through when your
poor father was alive, and I know all about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t understand you, mother,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>Barbara impatiently. She could not bear a
word to be even hinted against Dick. She
slipped her hand into her pocket and softly
touched his note.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will come back to-morrow, Barbara?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Probably,” replied Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will spend to-night at my house?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If necessary, I will do so, mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara could scarcely eat. She broke a
piece of toast up mechanically and put dry
morsels into her mouth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am certain there is nothing the matter,”
said Mrs. Evershed cheerfully. “To-morrow
will be Christmas Eve. Would you like me
to carry on the arrangements you have already
made?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Please, mother, yes, certainly. I will desire
the servants to come to you for orders,
and Mrs. Posset will, of course, manage the
housekeeping. There won’t be much for you
to do, but order the carriage whenever you
want it. Make yourself as happy as you
can. I am sorry to have to leave you, dear
mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder what is wrong,” thought Mrs.
Evershed when Barbara left the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>A few moments later young Lady Pelham
left the Towers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara did not look back as she was bowled
up the avenue. Had she done so she would
have seen little Mrs. Ives standing near one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>of the side entrances bobbing her accustomed
curtseys.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives was in a sad state of indecision.
She had also received a letter by that morning’s
post. It was from her daughter Clara.
Clara had desired her to stay where she was,
to keep her secret, and on no account to leave
Pelham Towers until she got further directions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Unless you want to ruin me forever, you
will do what I require,” wrote Clara in her
peremptory manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Ives was shaken and agitated.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ask, both for your sake and that of the
child,” said Clara finally, and Mrs. Ives felt
that she must submit.</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile Barbara hurried quickly up to
town. Oh, that she could get to Dick on the
wings of thought! The long delay, the awful
suspense were terrible.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last the journey was over and she found
herself at Paddington. She had come up to
town without luggage, and got into a hansom
immediately. Until this moment she had not
remembered that she did not really know
where to find Dick. When the cabman asked
her for directions she paused for a moment to
consider.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Drive to 12 Ashley Mansions, near Harley
Street,” she said to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man whipped up his horse and in a
short time the cab drew up at the familiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>door. Barbara got out, ran up the steps, and
rang the bell. The servant, who knew her
well, opened the door. He started quite perceptibly
when he saw her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is Mrs. Pelham in?” asked Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Lady Pelham, but——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must see her immediately.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will let her know that you have called,
Lady Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s face was certainly queer. He
stood in such a position that Barbara had almost
to push past him into the hall.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t keep me,” she said. “I will go
and see Mrs. Pelham without being announced.
Is she in the drawing-room?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe so, my lady. But if you will excuse
me, my lady——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara did not hear, she was already half-way
up the stairs. The next moment she had
entered the well-known drawing-room. Mrs.
Pelham was seated with her back to her, busily
writing. The widow’s little figure looked alert,
even the back of her head seemed full of a
new resolution.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara went silently up to her and touched
her on the arm. Mrs. Pelham turned with a
start. When she saw Barbara she became
very white.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>You</em>, you have come here?” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I am here, Mrs. Pelham. Can you
tell me where Dick is?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>“But don’t you know anything, Barbara?”
cried the widow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not yet, but I will know. Put me out of
suspense. Tell me at once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Barbara, I cannot. I wish you had not
come here. This is dreadful.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me at once, Mrs. Pelham. Do you
think I am silly? Don’t you know that I am
a woman—that I have got both strength and
courage? I know that something dreadful
has happened. What is it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose I must tell you, but I wish
some one else would. Your husband——”
Mrs. Pelham paused to wet her lips. They
were already so dry she could scarcely bring
out the words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your husband—Dick, has been——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Arrested.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Arrested! My husband arrested! What
for? Oh, for God’s sake tell me quickly!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Barbara, I will—that is, I will try.
I know it is an awful shock for you, poor
girl! But, Barbara, your husband, Dick, has
been arrested on suspicion of having——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, yes, on suspicion of what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of having murdered my little Piers!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Mrs. Pelham, what utter nonsense!”
said Barbara. The accusation was so monstrous,
so unfounded, that her first feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>was one of relief. She even gave a strange
and hollow laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What nonsense!” she repeated. “Dick
accused of murdering Piers! Dick, who
loved him! Mrs. Pelham, has anybody gone
mad?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My poor child, I don’t wonder at your
taking it like this. I felt somewhat as you do
at the first moment, but it is all too, too true.
I thought, of course, you must know by this
time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me more—tell me quickly. Where
is Dick now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was examined before the magistrate
this morning, Barbara. I was there—I had to
be present. He is remanded until—until——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not understand,” said Barbara. “It
is so ridiculous. I know you are trying to tell
me the most awful thing in the world, but it
is so utterly false that I cannot feel it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She laughed again; her laugh sounded
awful.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just tell me the whole story from beginning
to end,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will, dear. I am most terribly sorry for
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But are you not sorry for him? You
surely do not believe it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my poor Barbara, my poor Barbara!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really, I think you must have gone mad,
too,” said Barbara. “Such a monstrous accusation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>and you look quite solemn! What
has become of the laws of England when they
accuse the most innocent man in the world?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Barbara, dear, it does not look so. I am
bound to say that the circumstantial evidence
is very, very grave. Oh, it has all come suddenly,
and I had to prosecute. Yes, I know
I am your enemy, Barbara.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you have done this?” said Barbara,
slowly. She backed away from Mrs. Pelham,
her face as white as death. The arrows were
beginning now to pierce her soul. “You have
done this?” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How could I help it, Barbara? My only
child! And it seems to me to be so abundantly
proved. Dick gave him that last dose
of medicine. Some one put something into
the medicine—hyocene. It is dreadful stuff—a
most fatal poison. It has been proved, or
almost proved, that Dick did it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And they say that Dick gave that medicine
with that dreadful poison in it to Piers, and
you believe it—you think he did it? But
Piers was supposed to die of heart disease.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This particular medicine would affect the
heart strongly, and the disease which was
mentioned in the death certificate would to all
appearance occur. It was a clever scheme.
Barbara, circumstantial evidence is heavy
against your husband.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know now what something Dick said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>in his letter means,” cried Barbara. “‘The
machinations of the wicked.’ I know what
that expression means now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They are going to exhume the little body,”
continued Mrs. Pelham, who was now crying
bitterly. “They are going down to Pelham
Towers, and they will open the little coffin,
and the doctor employed by the Crown—for,
of course, the Crown prosecutes in a case like
this—will exhume the child’s little body.
Even in his grave my darling must not rest
in peace. They will have to do so in order
to prove whether the child really swallowed
the poison or not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who has told you all this?” asked Barbara.
She began to tie the strings of her
cloak with trembling fingers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Luke Tarbot, of course. Where are you
going, dear? I feel so bitterly for you. I
know that you at least are perfectly innocent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder you think so,” said Barbara. “I
would almost rather you did not. If Dick
could be guilty of such a monstrous crime,
why should not I connive at it? Oh, this is
too fearful! I am going away, Mrs. Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where to?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It does not matter to you, for you are
Dick’s enemy—Dick, who loved you! But
stay, Dick himself had suspicions. He suspected
Dr. Tarbot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is one of the strong cases against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>him, Barbara. His causeless suspicions, his
restlessness, his acute misery after the death
of the child, have been strongly commented
on, and will prove a powerful lever against
him. What earthly motive would Dr. Tarbot
have in injuring the child?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, that I have to find out,” said Barbara.
“Well, good-by. I am thankful I came up to
town. My Dick! Yes, the accusation is too
monstrous. Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lady Pelham left the room without touching
Mrs. Pelham’s hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>She went into the street. Her eyes were
bright; she held herself erect; she did not
look like a woman stricken down. Now was
the time to act. Once or twice as she hurried
along in the direction of Harley Street she
even laughed to herself. She soon reached
Dr. Tarbot’s house and rang the bell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is Dr. Tarbot in?” she asked of the
servant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, ma’am. What name shall I say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lady Pelham. I wish to speak to him
immediately.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man stared at her with undoubted curiosity—curiosity
so great that even the mask
which he was, as a servant, obliged to wear
was slightly lifted. He showed Barbara into
the waiting-room and went to inform his master.
In an instant he came back, threw open
the door for Lady Pelham, said that Dr. Tarbot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>would see her, and took her into the
consulting-room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot came eagerly forward—his face very
white and very thin, his lips parted. Barbara
went straight up to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have just seen Mrs. Pelham,” she said,
“and she has told me everything. So you
are in this—you came down to Pelham Towers
for the purpose of putting suspicion into Mrs.
Pelham’s mind. You have caused my husband
to be arrested on this most false charge.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is no use in taking matters in that
spirit, Lady Pelham,” said Tarbot. “The
magistrate who this morning examined your
husband with extreme care and justice does
not agree with you in calling the charge
false.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a trumped-up charge against one of
the best men God ever made,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You cannot prove it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will prove it yet. But what I have come
about now is to ask why <em>you</em> have interfered
in this matter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why did you get Mrs. Pelham to prosecute
my husband?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I only told her the simple truth. I could
not do otherwise—the burden rested too heavy
on my soul.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your eyes belie your words. You did not
do it for that reason.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>An evil spirit seemed to leap out of Tarbot’s
face at that moment, and he came closer to
Barbara. Barbara did not repel him. On
the contrary, she looked full at him. His
eyes quailed for a moment under her gaze;
then they were lifted, and she saw the triumph
in them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have not answered my question,” she
said. “Even granted that there was truth in
what you said, why should you be the one to
take the initiative?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you really want to know?” His
voice had dropped now to a low tone, his white
lips trembled, he came yet closer. Suddenly
Barbara felt his hand laid heavily on her
shoulder. She did not shrink from his touch.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shall I really tell you?” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did it because of you. I loved you, and
you treated me with scorn. If you had married
me I could have been a good man. As it is,
I am a bad one. I was glad to have this handle
against your husband. Having discovered
the truth, I was glad to incite Mrs. Pelham
to prosecute. Why? Because it hurt you—it
hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The touch of his hand felt like fire. Barbara
noticed it for the first time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me go,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will not. My moment of triumph has
come, and I shall take it.” The next instant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>he had caught her in both his arms, and was
pressing his burning kisses on her lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You drove me mad,” he said, “but this is
my hour of triumph. I loved you, and you
treated me with scorn. Yes, I am bad now,
and you are the cause. When your husband
hangs for this crime, my revenge will be
complete.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are a monster, and I treat you with
the contempt you deserve,” cried Barbara.
“Touch me again if you dare!” She extricated
herself from his grasp with a sudden
quick movement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My husband will be cleared,” she said.
“As there is a God above, he is innocent, and
I defy you, Dr. Tarbot. Don’t keep me, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She left the room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE LAST STRAW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Barbara had scarcely gone before the door
of the consulting-room was opened, and Clara
came in. Clara wore her old gray bonnet and
cloak, her nurse’s dress.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot, who was standing by the mantelpiece
with an excited look in his eyes and his lips
still trembling, turned when she entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Leave me,” he said. “I cannot speak to
you at present. Go away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t keep you long,” answered Clara
very gently. She was interrupted by a fit of
coughing. Try as she would, she could not
restrain it. Her face became crimson, and her
features worked. She struggled hard with this
convulsion of nature. Presently it passed, but
not until the handkerchief which she had
pressed to her lips was stained with blood.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot stood a few feet away regarding her,
and his face wore a malignant scowl. Clara
slipped her handkerchief into her pocket, and
sat down on the nearest chair, panting as she
did so.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>“You are ill,” said Tarbot. “When you
have done your business here as witness at
the trial, you had better go to Algiers for the
winter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will leave that matter for the present,”
said Clara. “I wish to tell you now that I
know exactly what you have done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What I have done?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. You have just had an interview with
Lady Pelham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that to you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A great deal. I am your wife. I happened
to see you just now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you played the spy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did, Luke, and I am not ashamed. I
opened the door softly. You were too much
occupied to notice me. I saw when you took
her in your arms—you, who are another woman’s
husband—kissed her. She repelled
you, as a good woman should. I have not
a word to say against her, but for you,
Luke, for you—this to me is—the very last
straw.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind!” he said excitedly. “You
shall go to Algiers when the trial is over. It
will come on in a fortnight. The man has
not a loophole of escape. The whole thing
will sweep to its ghastly conclusion in a few
weeks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you sure?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>“I was only thinking of the ace of trumps.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Again you talk in that ridiculous way.
You made use of that expression before.
What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will know presently. Good-by, Luke.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clara did not say anything further. She
went into the hall, opened the hall door, and
let herself out. Walking somewhat unsteadily
and feebly, swaying now and then from side to
side, she got as far as the end of the street.
Here she hailed a hansom, and desired the
man to drive her to Paddington. When she
got there she took the next train to Haversham.</p>

<p class='c010'>About half-way down the line she took a
letter out of her pocket. It was directed to
her husband. She gave it a queer look, and
there was an ominous glitter in her eyes.
When she reached a large junction she
called a porter to her, gave him sixpence
and asked him to post her letter. The man
promised to obey. Clara sank back in her
seat with a sigh of relief, and the train moved
on.</p>

<p class='c010'>She arrived at Haversham late that evening.
It was only a wayside station, and there were
no cabs. She had to walk the entire distance
to Great Pelham. The night was a wet one,
and the heavy rain penetrated through Clara’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>cloak. She was damp through and through.
She reached the “Pelham Arms” about ten
o’clock. When she got there she spoke to
one of the waiters.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get some tea at once in the coffee-room,
and order a cab. I want to drive to Pelham
Towers,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man looked eager when she pronounced
the name, for already strange news was beginning
to be whispered with regard to Pelham
Towers. The account of the trial had come
down in the evening papers, and the whole
country rang with the news.</p>

<p class='c010'>The tea was brought, and Clara drank it off,
for she was parched with thirst and fever. In
less than ten minutes she was driving to the
Towers. She got there about half-past ten.
She desired the man to take her to the side
entrance. One of the servants came out and
stared when she saw her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have called to speak to a person who I
believe is here—a person of the name of Ives,”
said Clara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is a little lady of that name in the
house. She’s in the housekeeper’s room,” said
the woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish to see her immediately.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What name shall I say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell her that her daughter has come, and
wants to speak to her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you please step in, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>Clara desired the cab to wait, and entered
the hall. A moment later Mrs. Ives came
out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Clary, thank the good God you have come.
I couldn’t keep it to myself another half an
hour. There’s bitter, bitter trouble. Clary, I
couldn’t have kept it to myself any longer
without going mad, and Mrs. Posset can
scarcely see from crying. Clary, what <em>do</em> it
mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It means that I want to speak to you,
mother, and immediately.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Posset’s stout form was now seen in
the doorway of her parlor. Mrs. Ives turned
and addressed her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My darter has come, ma’am,” she said,
“and wants to see me on a matter of special
business. There ain’t nothing surprising that
’appens nowadays, but ef I could see her alone
for a few minutes it might be a convenience
for all concerned.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can see her in here,” said Mrs. Posset.
She went out of the room as she spoke. Clara
and her mother entered. Clara sank down
panting on the sofa.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Help me to take my cloak off,” she said.
“I am not long for this world, but I want to
unburden my soul before I go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean, child? How awful
you look!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mother, where is the boy?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>“I wish to God that I knew, but I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He hasn’t come here, then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, and your letter kept me here, and
it was like imprisoning me. I’m near mad keeping
it all to myself, and now there’s the news
that Sir Richard Pelham has been arrested for
the murder of the little chap who is alive and
well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, yes, mother, I know all that, and we
will put it right. I have come down for the
purpose, but we must find the boy, and we
have not a moment to lose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll tell the truth, Clary?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As there is a God above.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank the Lord, thank the Lord! But,
child, how queer you look!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am dying, mother, but I shan’t die until
I have told the truth. I have suffered much,
and the last straw, the last straw came to-day.
You have heard of it, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To be sure, child, to be sure! But <em>how</em>
queer you look!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I am bad, my heart aches, and my
body aches, and there’s no rest for me on
earth. Come, mother, put on your bonnet. I
told the cab to wait, and we must leave here
to-night. We must find the child.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They say,” cried Mrs. Ives, “that a doctor
is coming down from London to-morrow morning. They’re going to open the vault, and
they are going to take out the coffin.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>“Let them. It doesn’t matter. Richard
Pelham will be saved. The beautiful young
lady will have a life of happiness. I go under
forever, but what does that matter? Come,
mother, come at once.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXV.<br /> <span class='large'>ACE OF TRUMPS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As soon as Clara left him, Tarbot put on his
hat and went to see the solicitor for the prosecution.
The latter had made an appointment
to see Tarbot between three and four o’clock.
He had a long interview with the doctor, in
which details with regard to Pelham’s trial
were most carefully gone into. Tarbot told
what he had to tell in a quiet voice, his face
calm and stern-looking. Now and then to a
close observer there might have been seen
what looked almost like a sorrowful expression
stealing round the lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Tarbot had given all his information
Mr. Cornish spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the way, this is an unpleasant business
for you,” he said. “That part about the <em>post
obit</em> will not sound too well. You got him to
sign that, remember.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did it simply because I had no other security
for my money. As matters have turned
out I know well that this part of the affair will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>not redound to my credit. But, after all,
what was I to do? I could not hold back
because of that. I was the child’s guardian,
remember, and Mrs. Pelham was my great
friend.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A case of conscience. I quite understand,”
said Cornish. “Well, it is all sad and terrible.
The case will go, without the slightest doubt,
against the prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You think so?” said Tarbot eagerly. In
spite of all his efforts his eyes danced now
with malignity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am certain of it,” said Cornish, glancing
up at him in some surprise. “The man will
hang for the crime. The jury will convict
him, and there won’t be a loophole for the
commutation of the sentence. I am sorry for
the young wife.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, she is the one to be pitied,” said
Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If any further particulars come to light you
will acquaint me?” said Cornish.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” replied Tarbot, rising as he spoke.
“By the way, have you given orders for the
exhumation of the body?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, the doctor for the Crown goes down
to Great Pelham to-night with his assistant and
the usual officers from Scotland Yard. You
clearly understand that Pelham is only remanded
for the present—he cannot be committed
for trial until the body has been exhumed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>and it is clearly proved that the child
swallowed the poison.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, yes, I see. Well, you are losing no
time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not. In a matter of this sort there
is no good in lingering over things. From
what you have told me it is only a mere matter
of form. The child of course swallowed
the hyocene. Pelham will be committed for
trial in a few days. You, of course, Dr. Tarbot,
will be served with a subpœna to appear
as witness for the prosecution. Your wife
will also have a notice to appear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who instructs for the defense?” asked
Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wilkinson; and Merriman is the barrister.
Merriman is the best criminal barrister we
have, but he cannot fight a case like ours,
although he will do his best.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why did we not secure him?” said Tarbot,
knitting his brows.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I think highly of my own man; and
in any case Merriman had been previously retained
for the defense.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a great pity we did not get him,” repeated
Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>The lawyer said nothing. The doctor bade
him good-by, and took his leave.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot went straight to see Mrs. Pelham.
He told her briefly what had occurred, gave
her a <em>resumé</em> of the present aspect of the case,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>and sitting down by her side, looked at her.
The widow’s expression was nervous and worn
to the last degree.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are not well,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>She burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I had never done it,” she cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Done what, my dear madam?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What I have done—prosecuted Dick. I
have broken the heart of the bravest girl in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarbot could not help shivering.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you allude to Lady Pelham?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do, Luke. She was here this afternoon.
How splendidly she spoke, and how grand was
her trust in her husband! Are you quite sure
that Dick—Dick, who has the most open face
in the world—did commit such a dastardly
crime?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Think for yourself. Go over the evidence,”
said Tarbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I have; but somehow lately I cannot
think about it. My head gets giddy, and I am
leaving it all to you. I wish I were dead and
in the grave with my murdered boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I pity you sincerely,” said Tarbot. “You
must stay quiet and hope for the best. It is
too late to change matters now, and it would
be very wrong, very wrong indeed, to leave
the child’s death unavenged.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He stayed for a few moments longer, and
then took his leave.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>On the following morning, amongst several
letters which lay on his breakfast table, Tarbot
received one from his wife. He had not noticed
Clara’s absence on the previous evening.
She was often away from dinner lately,
her health being far from good. Occasionally
she spent whole days in bed. He used to
hear her coughing, but he never went to her.
When he saw her letter, however, on the
breakfast table, he could not help giving a
start. It bore a country postmark. He
opened it and read the following words:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told you, Luke Tarbot, that there was
such a thing as the last straw. There is also
such a thing as the worm turning. I have
reached the last straw, and, to employ the
other metaphor, I am the worm, much trodden
on and much suffering, who has at last turned.
Now listen to what I am going to say. I am
on my way to Haversham. From there I shall
go straight to Pelham Towers. Do you know
why? To tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth. It was always your good
pleasure to laugh at my mesmeric powers.
When you read this letter you will no longer
smile at them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am about to explain to you what I meant
when I spoke of possessing the ace of trumps.
Read and consider my words carefully. You
often told me that Dr. Weismann of Paris was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>a humbug. Listen and tremble. He was no
humbug. He was a man who possessed a
marvelous personality, a strange and occult
power. He imparted his knowledge to me,
and I also found after some practise that I
possessed the same intangible power. When
you thought the child was dead he was not
dead at all—he never died. That time when
you wrote a certificate of his death he was
only in a mesmeric sleep or trance. With
care and cunning I had brought him to that
pass. I never gave him a drop of the hyocene
which you had provided me with. From time
to time I subjected him to certain influences
which produced trance. He got quickly and
completely under my power.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the night you saw him his condition
simulated death so well that you were taken
in. It resembled a similar case in Paris which
I attended, in which death was so completely
simulated that three physicians were taken
in, and pronounced the patient dead.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Luke,
little Sir Piers has never died. I weighted his
coffin with iron weights wrapped in wool. I
took the boy to my own lodgings. He is well
now—in perfect health. My mother has the
care of him, and when I tell my story I am
going to produce him. Your whole case,
therefore, falls to the ground. I tell you now
in order that you may if you like leave the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>country while there is time. I give you this
one last chance for the sake of the old love
which I felt for you.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. A fact.</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Your revenge, Luke Tarbot, has come to
nothing. Had you given me any return for
the love which I lavished upon you, I would
have been true to you to the extent of sinning
for you, and going hand in glove with you in
this. As it is, I have ceased to love you. I
shall be punished, but it does not matter, for
my days are numbered, and I would far rather
spend them in prison than have the life of a
brave and gallant gentleman like Richard Pelham
any further imperiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know the worst now, Luke, you
know all. My ace of trumps is little Sir Piers,
who is alive and well.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Clara.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There is such a thing as a bad man’s frenzy,
and it is best to draw the veil over it. Tarbot
had wild ideas at first of rushing after Clara
and murdering her on the spot in order to
secure her silence, but as each futile thought
swept through his brain he pushed it away as
hopeless and impracticable. After a couple
of hours of thought which no one need envy
him, he went with stealthy and quick movements
to pack a few belongings into his
Gladstone bag. From his house he rushed
to his bank, drew what balance he possessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>there, and took the morning train to the
Continent.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had the sense to see that his game was
up. There was nothing whatever for him but
flight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>SIR PIERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It occurred to little Sir Piers that it would
be a good thing if now, that he was quite well,
he went home. As no one was inclined to
take him, he thought he would go by himself.
That would not be exactly breaking his secret,
for surely if he were well he might go home
to his mother and to Dick and to Barbara. He
thought the matter over in the puzzled and yet
wise way of seven years old. He did not wish
to be unkind to his nurse or unkind to grannie,
but, all the same, it seemed to him only fair
that he should at least see the old place again,
and behold his mother, if even at a distance,
and see Barbara, the lady with the starry brown
eyes, and Dick, the hero of his boyish dreams.</p>

<p class='c010'>So when Mrs. Ives went to London Piers
quickly made up his mind. He had no money,
but he had a shrewd wit, a brave spirit, and a
gentleman’s heart. When darkness fell he
left the cottage and walked quickly up the high
road. Piers was dressed by Clara’s orders
just as any other peasant boy. He wore a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>shabby blouse, much worn knickerbockers,
and socks which revealed his bare legs above
them. His socks were blue, coarse homespun,
his shoes were also coarse, and just what a
village boy would wear.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, though Clara and her mother disguised
the lad in these clothes, they could not take
away his gallant figure, his beautiful face, his
dancing eyes, and his classical features. They
could not take away a certain personality which
raised him above the common herd. Still, in
the dusk no one would specially notice these
things, and a village boy wandering about was
not likely to attract attention. He walked he
did not know where, for a very long time.
He was under the impression that he was going
in the direction of Devonshire. Whenever
he met any one he asked where Devonshire
was, and as a rule the person spoken to pointed
in a certain direction, and Piers walked on.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he got to a cottage he went to the door
and asked for a drink of water. There was
something wonderfully appealing in his dark
eyes, and he usually received either a hunch
of bread or a big glass of milk instead, so that
although he had no money he did not starve,
and as the first night was a warm one he lay
down under the shelter of a great hayrick,
burrowing a little way into it, and so escaping
the worst of the cold and chill. Early in the
morning he got up and walked on again, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>thus he continued, journeying by easy stages,
receiving food from time to time from the cottagers,
and attracting little or no attention for
two days.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had really at last crossed the borders
and was in Devonshire. He was footsore and
weary, and Devonshire was a big place, and he
had not the least idea in what part of it Pelham
Towers was situated. It occurred to him early
on the morning of the third day that he must
do something more. His boots were much
worn with walking, and his dress untidy. His
knees were torn from some thorns, and his
face had lost its color; his eyes, too, had a
strained and anxious expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>He began to see his home in his dreams.
He began to dream when he walked as well
as when he lay down; he was very anxious
indeed. The longing to see his mother and
Barbara grew keener and keener. He had
never realized before that walking was so tiring.
It seemed hard that he should have to walk
and be so hungry when he was in reality such
a rich little boy—a king in his way—with five
big places of his own.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he was thinking these thoughts in the
early morning he saw a gentleman coming
towards him in a gig. The gentleman had
red whiskers and a red face. He was a stout
personage, and he was driving a chestnut
cob with a firm hand.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>“Please stop!” said Piers, running into the
middle of the road and holding up his own
thin hand to arrest attention.</p>

<p class='c010'>The child had suddenly made up his mind
to ask the gentleman to help him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now it so happened that this man, a certain
Squire Furzby, had been reading the account
of the magistrate’s inquiry into the strange
case of Sir Richard Pelham. He had been
reading it with great interest, for, of course,
he knew the Pelhams of Pelham Towers well.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Please stop!” called little Piers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The gentleman drew up his horse and said
“Hullo!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is this Devonshire, please?” asked Piers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You ought to know that, my little man.
You were born here, I make no doubt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is quite true, I was born in Devonshire,”
replied Piers. “But I have come from Cornwall.
I have walked a very long way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a queer little chap! Can I do anything
for you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Piers gazed earnestly up at Squire Furzby.</p>

<p class='c010'>“May I speak to you as one gentleman to
another?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Squire gazed hard at the battered and
much dilapidated little apparition in the road.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As one gentleman to another? Yes,
certainly,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As I am in Devonshire, and as tickets cost
a great deal,” continued Piers, “I was going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>to ask if you would drive me to the nearest
railway station, and if you would lend me my
fare, third-class. I’m seven years old, so I
shall only want a half-ticket to a station called
Haversham.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What an extraordinary boy! What do
you want to go to Haversham for? Have you
no money of your own?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Piers held up his two empty hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have a great deal of money,” he said.
“I am a very rich boy.” He paused.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t tell you any more; but will you
trust me with a third-class fare to Haversham?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The nearest railway station is half a mile
away, just behind those trees,” said Squire
Furzby.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Please will you take me there? I will
promise so faithfully to return the money if
you’ll lend it to me; on my honor, you know—and
as you are a gentleman, and I’m another.
Do you think you could trust me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your ticket at half-price third-class costs
one and elevenpence,” said the gentleman.
“I happen to know that line well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would you lend it me? It will be such
an immense help.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you confide in me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s just what I can’t do. I am an unfortunate
boy burdened with a secret. Will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>you trust me because you are a gentleman and
because I am one?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Pon my word, you’re the queerest little
chap I ever saw in my life. Can’t you tell me
anything about yourself?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My Christian name is Piers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s an uncommon name.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is, but not in our family. You shall
have your money back to-morrow or the next
day at farthest. One and elevenpence won’t
break you, will it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” said the gentleman. “Jump up,
Piers; I’ll drive you to the station, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The child obeyed, and a moment later was
seated by the man’s side. The Squire whipped
up his pony.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you want to do when you get to
Haversham?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want to go to Pelham Towers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pelham Towers! Hullo! They’re in great
trouble over there, you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are they? I don’t know,” said little Piers.
His face was white, he began to shiver. They
reached the railway station.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you trust me with the one and elevenpence,”
asked the child, “because you’re a
gentleman and I’m another?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Pon my word, I begin to think you are a
gentleman,” said the Squire. “Here’s your
money. Take three shillings, you had better—you’ll
want something to eat on the way.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>“Thank you very much,” said Piers. He
took off his ragged cap, made a graceful bow
to the gentleman, and then bounded into the
station.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Queer little chap! Wonder what it
means?” said the Squire to himself. “Looked
like a gentleman although dressed as a beggar.
I am not sorry I did it, no, I’m not sorry. I’ll
never see that money again, of course, but all
the same, I’m not sorry I did it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile little Piers, having taken his
ticket, waited eagerly for the train. It came
up in due course. He took his seat in an
empty carriage and soon found himself in the
old familiar landmarks. He felt quite happy
now and his heart light. It was delightful to
be so near home again.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the train drew up at Haversham he
got out and walked steadily in the direction of
Pelham Towers. On his way he passed a
cottage where bread and milk were sold. He
went in and proudly paid for his own breakfast.
By and by he reached the avenue. He
saw the lodge gates, but now as he saw them
he began to tremble, for it suddenly occurred
to him that after all his secret still belonged to
Clara, and that he had faithfully promised her
not to reveal it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know that short cut just where the gap
in the hedge is,” thought the child. “I’ll
not go round by the lodge, for some one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>might see me. I’ll push my way through the
gap.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He did so, and the next moment he was
running down a side path which led straight
to the chapel. The chapel door was open and
Piers walked in. It was cold in the chapel,
but he was hot with walking. He took off his
cap, pushed back his curls, and seated himself
in the family pew. He had often sat there
with his mother, and he felt quite comfortable
and soothed and happy. No one was likely to
come to disturb him. He could think what
his next step should be—how he could gratify
his longing, his passionate longing to see his
mother and Barbara, and the old place, and
yet keep his secret.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently he started up, raised his eyes, and
confronted the white tablet which recounted
his own early death. He read it eagerly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What does it mean?” he said to himself.
“Piers Pelham, aged seven, died. Died!
But I have not died. Piers Pelham! There
never was any other Piers Pelham, aged seven,
but me, and that white stone looks new, and
there’s a verse under it. I died last summer—last
August. But I didn’t die. I’m here.
What does it mean? I don’t like it,” thought
little Piers.</p>

<p class='c010'>He heard voices outside: he looked around
him. He went down the aisle and entered
the churchyard. There was a commotion in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>the churchyard. A couple of grave-looking
professional men were standing together and
talking in low tones. One or two other men,
also complete strangers to Piers, stood by.
Some masons were busy taking away the
entrance stone to the old vault.</p>

<p class='c010'>Piers knew that vault. He had often glanced
at it with silent dread when he passed on into
the church with his mother. Sometimes when
he had bad dreams he thought of his ancestors
lying in the vault, and he wondered what
sort of a place there was inside. As he came
now into the sunlight the entrance stone had
just been moved away, and he caught a glimpse
of the black interior. He did not like it—it
made his heart beat painfully. No one was
looking at him, however. There was painful
work on hand, and the attention of all this
queer company was attracted towards it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Piers moved softly aside in the direction of
the old yew tree. He did not want any of
these strangers to notice him.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the other side of the yew tree stood Gaffer
Crayshaw. Gaffer Crayshaw knew he ought
not to be there. If he were discovered he
would be ordered to go quickly about his business,
but he trusted no one would see him.
With his old body pressed against the yew
tree, he was peering out through the branches,
his eyes fixed upon the scene which was
taking place around the vault. He did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>notice Piers, but Piers recognized him at a
glance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Old Crayshaw,” thought the child. “He
used to give me barley sugar. He’ll tell me
what it all means.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The little fellow stepped cautiously around,
making no noise as he did so. He stood
at last just behind Gaffer. Presently Piers’s
small hand was laid on the old man’s arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are they doing over there?” asked
the child. “What are they doing in the vault?
Are they burying anybody?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Tain’t that. Hush! Don’t speak!” said
the old man. He half glanced round and saw
a little figure in the ordinary blouse of a village
boy standing beside him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get away, you little beggar,” he continued.
“Get out of this. Hush! Get you gone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what are they doing?” pleaded
Piers. His voice became a little more shrill.</p>

<p class='c010'>In despair Crayshaw thought it best to answer
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They ain’t a-burying nobody, but they’re
a-taking somebody out of his coffin. Yes, there
they come and the coffin with them. That’s
the coffin that holds little Sir Piers Pelham—bless
him! Poor little chap! They’re taking
it out, and they’re going to open it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I’m not there!” cried Piers.</p>

<p class='c010'>His voice rang out very high and clear. It
startled old Crayshaw, who turned round and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>looked at him for the first time attentively.
The old man’s face turned white, he clapped
his two hands to his ears, uttered a loud and
terrified shriek, and fled from the spot as if he
were pursued by a thousand demons.</p>

<p class='c010'>Piers did not take any notice of him. One
of the doctors who was bending over the coffin
glanced up with an annoyed expression of face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go away, little boy,” he said; and then he
gave directions to one of the men beside him.
The man stepped forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I’m not going away!” said little Piers.
“This is my own churchyard and my own
chapel. What are you doing here? You are
to go away—I’m not going.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man was about to reply angrily, and to
push the little intruder from the scene, when
suddenly there was a fresh commotion. Some
steps were heard approaching—eager steps,
the steps of women. Piers burst from the restraining
hand of the man. He had the boy in
his grip, but the child wriggled away as if he
were a little eel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Barbara!” cried Piers. “Barbara!” He
rushed down the path. A lady with starry
brown eyes was coming up, a lady with a
white face, and a world of indescribable sorrow
in her eyes. She was accompanied by some
one else, but at her Piers had no time to
glance. He flung his arms round Barbara’s
neck.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>“What does it mean?” he cried. “What
does it mean? Here I am. I’m back again.
I’m alive and well. What does it mean, dear,
darling, darling Barbara?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it a dream?” cried Barbara. “Are you
a spirit or in the flesh? Oh, Piers, speak, for
heavens sake! Oh, my heart will break!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I am as alive as possible,” said Piers
in a tone of astonishment. “I never was dead
at all. What can it mean? I, dead and in
my coffin! And they have stuck my name on
a tablet in the church. What can it mean? I
didn’t die aged seven. I’m alive. Feel me.
Isn’t my arm strong? Aren’t my cheeks rosy?
It was grannie did all that. I love grannie
and I love Clara, but I can’t, no, I can’t keep
my secret any longer, Clara. There you are,
nurse, I see you. Oh, Barbara, kiss me. Barbara,
take me back to mother. Where’s
Dick? Oh, Barbara, Barbara!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Barbara Pelham was too brave a girl to faint
even in the presence of such an emergency.
It is true that she grasped hold of Clara Tarbot,
and looked with terrified eyes from Clara
to the boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is here—God bless him!—and alive,”
cried Clara. “I will tell you all. I came
down for the purpose. I have a terrible confession
to make.” But the words had scarcely
passed her lips before her composure gave
way, her strength, already strained to the utmost,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>vanished, and the unhappy woman sank
in a fit of unconsciousness on the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>All further explanations can be quickly made.
Clara recovered in time to make full confession.
This she did in the presence of the doctors
and the police constables, who took down
her depositions word for word as they fell
from her dying lips. She was taken to the
house and tenderly nursed, and no word of reproach
was uttered to her, for those who bent

instrumental in saving the life of the boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to Piers himself, he and Barbara went
up to town that afternoon. Barbara took the
boy straight home to his mother, and then
went to acquaint the magistrates with the
strange turn affairs had taken. She held Clara’s
deposition in her hand. So Dick was liberated
and the celebrated trial came to nothing,
and little Piers is still the reigning baronet of
the house of Pelham—a gracious and kindly
lad, who will grow up into a good and brave
man. He has repaid Squire Furzby, who is
one of his stanchest friends, and is never
tired of telling of the dull winter’s morning
when, having given, as he considered, three
shillings to a beggar, he had in reality saved
a great family from the extreme of tragedy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dick Pelham has, after all, to work for his
own living, but is none the less happy on that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>account, and Barbara has gladly resigned the
title which, as she confessed afterwards, gave
her more pain than pleasure.</p>

<p class='c010'>Grannie Ives has a house on the estate and
spends every Sunday with Mrs. Posset. Between
them they do their best to spoil Piers,
but they do not succeed. A warrant is out
for the arrest of Luke Tarbot, and the police
are still busy searching for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The time of the story is 1748, its scene being along the seacoast of Sussex, England.
The doings here of the “free-traders,” as they called themselves, or smugglers, as the
government named them, had become so audacious that a revenue cutter with a smart
young lieutenant in command, and a brigade of cavalry, were sent down to work together
against the offenders. Everybody in the village seems engaged in evading the revenue
laws, and the events are very exciting. Joan is the parson’s daughter, and so capable and
useful in the parish that she is called “the curate.” She and the smart young lieutenant
are the characters in a romance.—<cite>Book Notes</cite>, May, 1899.</p>

<p class='c010'>The author of the once immensely popular “House on the Marsh” turns in her new
story to the Sussex coast as it was in the middle of the last century. The time and the
place will at once suggest smugglers to the observant reader, and, in truth, these gentry
play an important part in the tale.—<cite>The Mail and Express</cite>, April 11, 1899.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Florence Warden in “Joan, the Curate” (F. M. Buckles &amp; Co.) tells an orthodox
tale of smugglers in the last century with plenty of exciting adventures and no deviations
from the accepted traditions of a familiar pattern in fiction.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>“Joan, the Curate” (Joan, a creamy-skinned, blackeyed maiden, gets her surname on
account of the part she plays in helping her father, Parson Langley, with his duties), is a
village tale of the smuggling days on the wild marsh coast of Kent and the equally lonely
cliffs of Sussex. The village is a hot-bed of these daring “free-traders,” even the parson
and his daughter are secretly in sympathy with them, and young Lieutenant Tregenna,
who is in command of the revenue cutter sent to overawe the natives, has anything but a
comfortable task to perform. His difficulties only increase when he falls in love with Joan
and discovers her leanings towards the illegalities of the village, and when, at the same
time, the audacious leader of the smugglers, Ann Price, who carries on her trade disguised
as a man, falls in love with him herself, the complications are almost bewildering. The
story moves through countless adventures, sanguinary fights, and lovers’ quarrels to the
conventionally happy ending and the partial return of the fishermen to honest ways.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>“The Real Lady Hilda,” by B. M. Croker, is a very pleasing novel, depending
for its interest not upon sensational incident, but upon a clever portrayal of
disagreeable traits of character in high society. The story is told by a young lady
who finds herself with her stepmother in obscure lodgings in an obscure country
town. The head of the family had been physician to a Rajah in India, had lived
in princely style and had entertained in princely fashion. He had died and left to
his widow and child nothing but a small pension, and they soon found themselves
in straightened circumstances. Besides the character drawing, the entertaining
feature of the story lies in the shabby treatment which the two impecunious
women receive from the people whom they have so royally entertained in India,
and the inability of the widow, with her Indian experience, to understand it.
Entertaining, too, is the fawning toadyism of the middle-class women, who disdainfully
tip their noses and wag their tongues when they find that the poor women are
neglected by the great lady in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Croker belongs to the group of English country life novelists. She is
not one of its chief members, but she succeeds often in being amusing in a quiet,
simple way. Her gentlefolk lack the stamp of caste, but the plots in which they
are placed are generally rather ingenious. Of course, in a field so assiduously
worked, one cannot look for originality. The present book is just what the author
modestly calls it—a “sketch,” with the usual poor girl of good family and the
equally familiar happy ending.—<cite>Mail and Express</cite>, May 1, 1899.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>“Good Mrs. Hypocrite.” A study in self-righteousness, is a most enjoyable
novel by “Rita.” It has little of plot, and less of adventure, but is the study of
a single character and a narration of her career. But she is sufficiently unique to
absorb the attention, and her purely domestic experiences are quite amusing. She
is the youngest daughter of a Scotch family, angular as to form and sour as to feature.
She had an aggressive manner, was selfish, and from girlhood set herself
against all tenderness of sentiment. Losing her parents, she tried her hand as a
governess, went to her brother in Australia, returned to England and joined a sisterhood
in strange garb, and her quarrelsome disposition and her habit of quoting
scripture to set herself right made her presence everywhere objectionable. For this
old maid was very religious and strict as to all outward forms. Finally she went to
live with an invalid brother. She discharged the servant, chiefly because she was
plump and fair of feature, and she replaced her with a maid as angular as herself,
straight from Edinbro’. The maid was also religious and quoted scripture, and the
fun of the story lies in the manner in which the woman who had had her way so
long was beaten by her own weapons.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Scotch character is held up in this story at its worst. All its harshness,
love of money, unconscious hypocrisy, which believes in lip-service while serving
but its own self, are concentrated in the figure of the old spinster who takes charge
of her invalid brother’s household. She finds a match, however, in the Scotch
servant she hires, hard like herself, but with the undemonstrative kindness that
seems to be a virtue of the race. The book lacks the charm that lies at the root
of the popularity of the books of the “Kailyard” school. In its disagreeable
way, however, it is consistent, though the melodramatic climax is not the ending
one has a right to expect.—<cite>The Mail and Express</cite>, June 21, 1899.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clark Russell in “Captain Jackman” has told a good story of the strange conduct of
a ship’s master, who starts out with a fake robbery by which he realizes £1500. The account
of his peculiar courtship and the still more peculiar acceptance of his offer by the
daughter of a retired naval commander is scarcely credible, but it is readable and the tragic
end is not improbable. It is a mere short story, expanded by large type into a volume.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Captain Jackman; or, A Tale of Two Tunnels,” is a story by W. Clark Russell,
not so elaborate in plot as some of his stories, or so full of life on the sea, but some of the
characters are sailors, and its incidents are of the ocean, if not on it. Its hero is dismissed
from the command of a ship by her owners, because of his loss of the proceeds of a voyage,
which they evidently think he had appropriated to himself. The heroine discovers him in
and rescues him from a deserted smuggler’s cave, where he had by some mischance imprisoned
himself. He handsome, she romantic as well, they fall in love with each other.
Her father, a retired commander of the Royal navy, storms and swears to no purpose, for
she elopes with the handsome captain, who starts on an expedition to capture a Portuguese
ship laden with gold—a mad scheme, conceived as it appears by a madman, which accounts
for his curious and unconventional ways,</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>It is readable, interesting, and admirable in its technical skill. Mr. Russell, without
apparent effort, creates an atmosphere of realism. His personages are often drawn with a
few indicative strokes, but this can never be said of his central figures. In the present little
story the fascinating personality of Captain Jackman stands our very clearly. He is a curious
study, and the abnormal state of his mind is made to come slowly into the recognition
of the reader just as it does into that of old Commander Conway, R. N. This is really
a masterly bit of story-craft, for it is to this that the maintenance of the interest of the
story is due. The reader does not realize at first that he is following the fortunes of a madman,
but regards Jackman as a brilliant adventurer. The denouement is excellently brought
about, although it gives the tale its sketchy character.—<cite>N. Y. Times</cite>, July 1, 1899.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is rather unusual to find a detective story written from the criminal’s
point of view, and truth to tell, in this “Rogue’s Conscience,” by David
Christie Murray, we find our sympathies and anxieties strongly following
the hunted ones. Mr. James Mortimer and Mr. Alexander Ross were such
entertaining sinners, and their disguises were so marvellous, and their
escapes so hair-breath, that we follow the comedy of their fortunes with unfailing
cheerfulness. When the scene shifts from city risks to the broad field
of mining camp speculations, we see the beginning of the end, for here the
“rogue’s conscience” commenced to work, and a double reformation ends the
book in a blaze of glory. The story has just enough seriousness to give it
balance but by no means enough to destroy the pleasantly light and entertaining
quality of the book.—<cite>Literary World</cite>, August 5, 1899.</p>

<p class='c010'>David Christie Murray has written an amusing tale of two unworthies in
“A Rogue’s Conscience.” “If you want to enlighten a rogue’s conscience,
serve him as he served other people—rob him,” observes the “hero,” who
has acquired the “sixth sense of honesty.” How he arrived at this sage conclusion,
and how he put the principle into effect, all tend toward the live
human interest of a story which shows no sign of lagging from beginning to
end. The tale is not free from tragedy, but even the sombre parts are handled
easily and lightly, as though the author believed them necessary, but yet felt
freer in the atmosphere of almost light-hearted roguery which pervades most
of the volume. The book is capital reading for a summer afternoon, and
action lurks on every page.—<cite>American</cite>, August 31, 1899.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two rogues, who figure in the novel as James Mortimer and Alexander
Ross, in alliance with a third scamp, forged an issue of the Bank of England.
The nameless third paid the penalty of his crime, but Mortimer and Ross,
through the clever scheming of Mortimer, escaped to British Columbia after
having added to their ill-gotten gains. Mortimer, apparently the most unscrupulous,
makes the singular atonement which transforms him into a hero.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A Man’s Undoing” is an exceptionally good novel by Mrs. H. Lovett
Cameron. It is not written to tickle the palate of the sated reader who is
looking only for new sensations, nor is it intended to amuse for a short hour.
It preaches no new doctrine; it presents no novelties of character or incident.
Its theme is as old as humanity—the burden of story and song through all the
ages. But Mrs. Cameron shows that it has lost none of its interest, that its
phases may be presented in new aspects, that the conventionalities of modern
civilization have not made it less a force in the affairs of men, nor obliterated
any of its eternal truths. Its influence over the lives of men and women varies
in extent and results, as the men and women vary in character, subject
always to variations of condition and environment; therefore it always presents
new studies. All the world loves a lover, and no one knows better than
Mrs. Cameron how to make a lover most interesting. Especially skillful is
she in her delineations of women who love. She paints other women also to
fill out her pictures—the narrow-minded old maids and the gossipy matrons,
and none of her women are repellingly bad—but her women who love have all
the nobility and strength of womanhood. As she deals with noble character,
so she deals with the serious affairs of life, of strong emotions, of heart histories,
with all their heroism and pathos. “A Man’s Undoing” is admirably
constructed. Its lessons will not be lost upon the thoughtful, and it will be
read with eager interest by all classes of novel readers.</p>

heavy; plenty light enough for summer reading; but the author, Mrs. H.

How the man came to be undone, as the result of a one-week flirtation—that
is for the readers to find out. The lover of a good story will not lay down the
book until the last page is turned. The volume appears in a cloth cover of

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
